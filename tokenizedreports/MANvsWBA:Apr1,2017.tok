2017
Manchester
United
frustrated
again
at
home
by
West
Brom
Manchester
United
stumbled
at
a
crucial
time
in
the
race
for
the
top
four
as
well-drilled
West
Brom
became
the
latest
side
to
hold
Jose
Mourinho
side
to
an
Old
Trafford
draw
.
No
team
can
match
United
's
unbeaten
Premier
League
run
stretching
all
the
way
back
to
October
,
nor
can
any
other
side
rival
their
unerring
knack
at
dominating
games
only
to
draw
.
West
Brom
were
the
eighth
side
to
leave
Old
Trafford
with
a
share
of
the
spoils
this
season
,
securing
a
0-0
draw
against
a
United
side
that
once
more
failed
to
eke
out
victory
.
Hull
,
Stoke
and
Burnley
are
among
the
others
to
have
frustrated
Mourinho
's
men
on
home
soil
,
leaving
them
scrapping
for
a
top-four
finish
rather
than
the
title
.
The
Europa
League
may
offer
United
their
best
chance
of
a
Champions
League
return
at
this
rate
,
with
West
Brom
sitting
deep
and
standing
firm
to
thwart
the
dominant
hosts
.
The
absence
of
Zlatan
Ibrahimovic
,
Paul
Pogba
,
Juan
Mata
and
Ander
Herrera
no
doubt
impacted
things
on
an
afternoon
when
a
drab
first
period
made
way
for
a
desperate
second
.
Darren
Fletcher
hit
the
bar
late
on
after
a
hopeful
drive
slipped
through
David
de
Gea
's
grasp
,
but
it
was
Ben
Foster
,
another
former
United
player
,
who
shone
brightest
as
United
drew
an
11th
league
match
of
the
season
.
Mourinho
will
no
doubt
bemoan
a
lack
of
cutting
edge
and
key
absentees
that
saw
Matthew
Willock
named
in
the
squad
for
the
first
time
-
a
decision
that
makes
England
left-back
Luke
Shaw
omission
all
the
more
puzzling
.
Tony
Pulis
'
men
strangled
the
life
out
of
the
toothless
hosts
in
the
first
half
.
Neither
Jesse
Lingard
's
half
volley
or
a
deflected
Anthony
Martial
effort
troubled
,
with
Marcus
Rashford
found
wanting
positionally
from
several
crosses
.
The
best
chance
of
an
uninspiring
opening
period
came
on
the
half-hour
mark
as
Martial
leapt
at
the
far
post
to
meet
a
fine
Lingard
cross
,
only
to
direct
his
header
wide
.
Boos
at
the
break
seemed
to
be
aimed
at
Mike
Dean
as
much
as
anything
,
with
the
referee
confronted
as
Martial
pointed
out
a
lump
beneath
his
eye
sustained
late
in
the
first
half
.
United
returned
with
a
change
in
mentality
if
not
personnel
,
piling
on
the
pressure
from
the
outset
.
Aside
from
Eric
Bailly
throwing
himself
in
front
of
a
scuffed
Fletcher
shot
,
there
was
precious
little
respite
for
the
visitors
as
Henrikh
Mkhitaryan
was
denied
by
a
last-ditch
challenge
and
Marouane
Fellaini
missed
the
follow-up
.
A
drive
from
Martial
skipped
wide
via
a
slight
deflection
off
Jake
Livermore
,
while
Mkhitaryan
chased
down
a
clearance
only
to
see
his
clipped
effort
denied
by
Foster
.
The
former
United
goalkeeper
produced
a
superb
one-handed
save
to
deny
Rashford
as
the
pressure
increased
,
with
Wayne
Rooney
's
introduced
in
a
bid
to
sway
the
fixture
.
Calls
for
Allan
Nyom
to
be
handed
a
second
booking
were
waved
away
before
Fletcher
's
rasping
strike
crept
through
De
Gea
's
hands
and
hit
the
crossbar
.
United
were
on
top
,
though
,
and
they
pushed
hard
for
a
late
winner
,
with
a
Rashford
free-kick
denied
wonderfully
by
man-of-the-match
Foster
.
Claudio
Yacob
and
Fellaini
's
heads
came
together
as
tempers
frayed
,
with
the
final
whistle
greeted
by
boos
.
