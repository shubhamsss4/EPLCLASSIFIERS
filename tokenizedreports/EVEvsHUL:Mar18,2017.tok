Romelu
Lukaku
scores
twice
as
Everton
comfortably
beat
Hull
Everton
striker
Romelu
Lukaku
ended
the
week
how
he
had
started
it
-
in
the
headlines
-
with
two
goals
in
the
4-0
win
over
10-man
Hull
.
On
Tuesday
the
Belgium
international
told
the
club
he
would
not
be
signing
the
new
140,000-a-week
contract
to
make
him
the
highest-paid
player
in
their
history
as
he
questioned
whether
they
had
the
ability
to
reach
the
Champions
League
.
His
double
on
Saturday
,
with
both
goals
in
stoppage
time
,
may
not
have
been
the
decisive
factor
in
putting
the
Toffees
level
on
points
with
fifth-placed
Arsenal
,
but
it
at
least
showed
his
professionalism
can
not
be
called
into
question
.
The
platform
had
been
laid
by
a
first
goal
for
20-year-old
Dominic
Calvert-Lewin
,
in
his
sixth
Premier
League
appearance
,
and
,
after
Tom
Huddlestone
's
red
card
,
another
from
Enner
Valencia
.
Lukaku
then
took
centre
stage
to
register
his
20th
and
21st
league
goals
of
the
season
,
the
first
time
an
Everton
player
has
reached
that
tally
since
Gary
Lineker
in
1985-86
.
The
win
puts
Everton
close
to
the
top
four
,
five
points
behind
Liverpool
with
the
Merseyside
derby
at
Anfield
up
next
after
the
international
break
.
Lukaku
's
comments
angered
Koeman
,
but
the
Dutchman
knew
only
too
well
dropping
the
Premier
League
's
top
goal
scorer
would
amount
to
cutting
off
his
nose
to
spite
his
face
.
However
,
for
nearly
80
minutes
an
unconvincing
performance
against
relegation
strugglers
appeared
to
be
adding
weight
to
the
striker
's
argument
.
Lukaku
always
had
Curtis
Davies
or
Harry
Maguire
--
two
of
Hull
's
three
centre-backs
--
in
close
attention
and
,
apart
from
scuffing
his
first
attempt
and
being
flagged
offside
as
he
stroked
a
shot
past
Eldin
Jakupovic
,
he
was
barely
involved
in
the
first
half
.
He
picked
up
after
the
break
,
with
one
shot
rifled
over
from
the
edge
of
the
penalty
area
and
another
fierce
angled
drive
tipped
behind
by
Jakupovic
,
which
had
the
Gwladys
Street
End
singing
his
name
.
He
did
,
however
,
finally
produce
a
significant
contribution
with
a
lobbed
assist
for
Valencia
to
score
Everton
's
78th-minute
second
within
a
minute
of
coming
off
the
bench
before
confidently
beating
Jakupovic
twice
in
stoppage
time
.
The
manner
in
which
one
grateful
fan
gleefully
accepted
Lukaku
's
shirt
when
he
hurled
it
into
the
crowd
at
the
final
whistle
showed
his
harsh
words
have
not
affected
his
popularity
--
helped
of
course
by
his
goals
.
With
all
the
focus
on
the
club-record
signing
's
future
,
it
was
a
trio
from
the
club
's
youth
teams
who
claimed
the
spotlight
with
the
eighth-minute
opener
.
Barkley
's
piercing
through-ball
inside
wing-back
Andrew
Robertson
picked
out
Tom
Davies
,
timing
his
run
perfectly
,
and
his
low
cross
was
side-footed
home
by
Calvert-Lewin
,
who
has
emerged
from
the
under-23s
this
season
after
arriving
from
Sheffield
United
in
2016
.
It
was
his
first
start
since
early
January
after
injury
.
But
the
pace
dropped
when
Gareth
Barry
replaced
the
injured
Morgan
Schneiderlin
and
Everton
were
almost
caught
napping
when
Ashley
Williams
'
hesitation
in
dealing
with
a
long
ball
saw
Sam
Clucas
'
lob
land
on
the
top
of
the
net
just
before
half-time
.
Koeman
switched
formation
to
match
Hull
's
three
at
the
back
as
the
visitors
began
to
gain
the
upper
hand
,
only
for
Huddlestone
's
dismissal
for
a
shin-high
challenge
on
Idrissa
Gana
Gueye
to
halt
their
momentum
in
the
73rd-minute
.
It
released
the
pressure
building
up
on
the
hosts
,
who
quickly
added
the
second
to
finally
kill
off
the
game
before
Lukaku
stole
the
spotlight
once
again
.
