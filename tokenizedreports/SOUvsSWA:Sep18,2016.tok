Charlie
Austin
scores
again
as
Southampton
beat
Swansea
Charlie
Austin
proved
his
point
by
climbing
off
the
bench
to
secure
Southampton
's
first
Premier
League
win
of
the
season
as
they
edged
out
Swansea
at
St
Mary
's
Stadium
.
The
striker
was
back
among
the
substitutes
against
the
Swans
despite
his
two-goal
heroics
in
the
Europa
League
win
over
Sparta
Prague
on
Thursday
night
.
But
having
watched
his
teammates
spurn
a
host
of
chances
to
take
the
lead
,
Austin
found
the
net
just
10
minutes
after
coming
on
to
snatch
a
1-0
victory
and
give
Saints
boss
Claude
Puel
his
first
three
points
in
the
English
top-flight
.
It
was
Austin
's
first
Premier
League
goal
since
his
debut
winner
against
Manchester
United
in
January
,
and
earned
Saints
a
deserved
three
points
from
a
dominant
display
.
Swansea
,
by
contrast
,
were
abject
and
remain
without
a
win
since
the
opening
day
of
the
season
.
They
were
without
defender
Neil
Taylor
,
conspicuous
by
his
absence
following
his
public
fall-out
with
manager
Francesco
Guidolin
,
who
subbed
him
before
half-time
against
Chelsea
last
weekend
.
But
it
was
in
attack
where
they
laboured
,
with
summer
signing
Fernando
Llorente
never
looking
like
opening
his
goal
account
.
Southampton
bossed
proceedings
from
the
off
and
were
almost
gifted
the
lead
when
keeper
Lukasz
Fabianski
spilled
a
shot
from
Shane
Long
.
Steven
Davis
and
Dusan
Tadic
charged
in
to
tuck
away
the
follow-up
only
to
get
in
each
other
's
way
and
put
the
ball
behind
,
but
fortunately
for
the
duo
an
offside
flag
spared
their
blushes
.
Long
thought
he
should
have
been
awarded
a
penalty
after
going
down
under
Ferderico
Fernandez
's
challenge
in
the
area
,
but
referee
Mike
Jones
saw
it
differently
and
booked
the
Saints
forward
for
a
dive
.
Long
's
mood
did
not
improve
when
Nathan
Redmond
opted
to
shoot
rather
than
square
the
ball
across
goal
and
blazed
his
effort
high
and
wide
.
And
Redmond
was
guilty
of
an
even
worse
miss
moments
later
when
he
collected
Tadic
's
low
cross
and
stepped
inside
Jordi
Amat
,
only
to
scoop
his
shot
over
from
eight
yards
out
.
The
one-way
traffic
continued
after
the
break
with
Long
nudging
the
ball
past
the
onrushing
Fabianksi
,
only
for
Kyle
Naughton
to
slide
in
and
clear
before
Tadic
could
tap
into
an
empty
net
.
Long
then
did
put
the
ball
into
the
net
but
Redmond
had
been
flagged
offside
as
he
pulled
the
ball
back
.
Long
's
afternoon
was
over
shortly
after
but
Austin
's
first
action
was
to
crash
Redmond
's
perfectly-weighted
ball
across
the
area
onto
the
crossbar
.
However
,
Austin
made
no
mistake
in
the
64th
minute
when
Tadic
's
cross
was
inadvertently
helped
on
by
Amat
,
chesting
the
ball
at
the
far
post
before
hammering
his
volley
past
Fabianski
.
Swansea
could
still
have
snatched
an
unwarranted
point
when
the
ball
dropped
to
Gylfi
Sigurdsson
in
the
area
,
but
Fraser
Forster
palmed
away
his
shot
to
ensure
Saints
got
their
league
season
up
and
running
.
