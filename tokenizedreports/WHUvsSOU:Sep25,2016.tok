West

United
VS
Southampton
Sep

2016
Southampton
secure
comfortable
victory
as
West
Ham
woes
go
on
Charlie
Austin
increased
the
gloom
at
West
Ham
with
his
fifth
goal
in
four
games
as
Southampton
ran
out
easy
3-0
winners
at
the
London
Stadium
.
The
unhappy
Hammers
remain
in
the
bottom
three
after
yet
more
woeful
defending
saw
them
slip
to
a
fifth
defeat
in
six
Premier
League
matches
.
And
the
man
who
set
Saints
on
their
way
was
Austin
,
the
player
Hammers
co-owner
David
Sullivan
once
claimed
that
he
did
not
try
to
sign
because
of
his
injury
record
.
But
Austin
did
not
look
like
a
player
who
has
no
ligaments
in
his
knee
--
as
was
claimed
back
then
--
when
he
opened
the
scoring
five
minutes
before
half-time
.
The
striker
then
set
up
Dusan
Tadic
to
tuck
away
the
second
and
James
Ward-Prowse
added
late
gloss
to
give
Southampton
a
first
away
win
of
the
season
and
leave
West
Ham
in
crisis
.
The
Hammers
are
confident
that
some
good
performances
on
the
pitch
will
ease
the
transition
from
Upton
Park
to
the
London
Stadium
--
but
this
was
no
way
to
go
about
it
.
In
a
dismal
first
half
Simone
Zaza
,
yet
to
score
since
his
summer
switch
from
Juventus
,
and
Michail
Antonio
both
fired
tamely
wide
.
And
having
soaked
up
what
little
pressure
West
Ham
offered
,
Saints
went
down
the
other
end
of
the
field
and
opened
the
scoring
with
their
first
shot
on
target
.
The
Hammers
,
who
had
conceded
eight
goals
in
their
previous
two
league
outings
,
allowed
Ryan
Bertrand
to
collect
Tadic
's
pass
as
he
raced
inside
makeshift
right-back
Havard
Nordtveit
and
cut
the
ball
back
for
Austin
to
slot
home
.
The
visitors
could
have
increased
their
lead
before
half-time
but
Adrian
saved
Nathan
Redmond
's
drive
at
his
near
post
and
Cedric
Soares
fired
into
the
side
netting
.
Zaza
's
frustration
continued
when
,
having
been
denied
what
he
felt
was
a
penalty
in
the
first
half
,
was
booked
for
a
dive
after
tumbling
under
Oriol
Romeu
's
challenge
in
the
area
.
Then
,
in
the
62nd
minute
,
more
shambolic
defending
saw
Winston
Reid
and
Cheikhou
Kouyate
lose
the
ball
between
them
and
allow
Austin
to
play
in
Tadic
,
who
stepped
around
the
onrushing
Adrian
before
rolling
the
ball
into
an
empty
net
.
West
Ham
belatedly
rallied
and
had
another
penalty
claim
turned
down
when
Sofiane
Feghouli
's
shot
hit
Bertrand
's
hand
,
while
Zaza
's
effort
was
cleared
off
the
line
.
But
in
stoppage
time
Redmond
and
Steven
Davis
combined
to
set
up
sub
Ward-Prowse
,
prompting
a
mass
exodus
of
Hammers
fans
.
Those
who
did
stay
until
the
end
made
their
feelings
known
on
another
miserable
afternoon
at
their
new
home
.
