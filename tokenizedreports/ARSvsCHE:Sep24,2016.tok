Arsenal
VS
Chelsea
Sep

2016
Arsenal
thrash
Chelsea
with
first
half
treble
at
the
Emirates
An
outstanding
first-half
performance
by
Arsenal
saw
them
beat
London
rivals
Chelsea
3-0
at
the
Emirates
and
go
third
in
the
Premier
League
table
.
The
Gunners
delivered
an
early
sign
of
intent
when
Alexis
Sanchez
saw
an
early
20-yard
strike
stopped
by
Thibaut
Courtois
.
And
they
were
2-0
up
after
14
minutes
as
Chelsea
's
defence
suffered
a
nightmare
afternoon
.
With
12
minutes
played
,
Gary
Cahill
dawdled
on
the
ball
before
making
a
mess
of
his
backpass
and
allowing
Sanchez
to
race
through
and
chip
coolly
beyond
Courtois
.
Two
minutes
later
,
the
Gunners
doubled
their
lead
with
a
superbly-worked
goal
as
Mesut
Ozil
and
Alex
Iwobi
set
up
Hector
Bellerin
to
cross
for
a
Theo
Walcott
tap-in
.
A
shell-shocked
Chelsea
offered
little
in
response
apart
from
a
low
Willian
effort
that
whistled
just
wide
of
the
far
post
and
were
three
goals
adrift
with
five
minutes
of
the
first
half
still
to
play
.
The
goal
began
on
the
edge
of
the
Arsenal
penalty
area
as
Ozil
turned
past
a
couple
of
challenges
and
raced
into
the
Arsenal
half
before
finding
Sanchez
.
The
forward
then
chipped
the
ball
over
Cahill
and
David
Luiz
,
who
had
both
been
drawn
towards
him
,
and
Ozil
volleyed
into
the
ground
,
over
Courtois
and
off
the
post
,
to
make
it
3-0
.
Diego
Costa
--
booed
by
the
home
fans
having
been
involved
in
controversial
incidents
against
Arsenal
in
the
past
--
tried
to
drag
his
team
back
into
the
contest
with
a
couple
of
strong
runs
at
the
start
of
the
second
half
.
But
it
was
the
Gunners
who
continued
to
have
the
chances
,
with
Walcott
crossing
too
high
for
Sanchez
and
the
Chilean
then
failing
to
find
Ozil
with
a
low
ball
to
the
far
post
.
Courtois
blocked
a
Walcott
drive
and
Granit
Xhaka
,
a
first-half
substitute
for
the
injured
Francis
Coquelin
,
lashed
over
the
bar
as
Arsenal
again
threatened
to
score
a
fourth
.
Chelsea
,
who
slip
to
eighth
after
a
second
successive
Premier
League
defeat
,
mustered
only
two
efforts
on
target
on
what
was
a
dismal
afternoon
for
new
boss
Conte
.
