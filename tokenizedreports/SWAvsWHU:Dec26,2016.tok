West
Ham
pile
pressure
on
Bob
Bradley
with
4-1
win
at
Swansea
West
Ham
turned
up
the
heat
on
embattled
Swansea
City
manager
Bob
Bradley
with
a
4-1
win
at
the
Liberty
Stadium
.
Andre
Ayew
--
with
his
first
Hammers
goal
following
his
20.5
million
move
from
Swansea
in
August
--
Winston
Reid
,
Michail
Antonio
and
Andy
Carroll
helped
the
Londoners
claim
a
third
successive
win
for
the
first
time
since
March
.
Fernando
Llorente
,
on
as
a
substitute
,
claimed
a
Swansea
consolation
two
minutes
from
time
with
his
fifth
goal
in
six
games
,
but
even
then
Carroll
had
the
final
word
.
The
victory
takes
West
Ham
towards
mid-table
but
these
are
dark
times
for
Swansea
and
their
American
manager
,
who
might
not
welcome
2017
in
a
job
he
was
only
appointed
to
in
October
.
Bradley
admitted
that
his
fate
might
rest
on
home
games
against
West
Ham
and
Bournemouth
,
on
New
Year
's
Eve
,
but
the
Swansea
fans
had
clearly
made
their
minds
up
when
Reid
headed
home
four
minutes
into
the
second
half
.
``
We
want
Bradley
out
,
''
reverberated
around
the
Liberty
Stadium
as
Swansea
were
consigned
to
the
seventh
defeat
of
the
American
's
11-game
reign
.
Supporters
also
turned
their
anger
on
chairman
Huw
Jenkins
,
who
had
used
his
programme
notes
to
defend
the
club
's
summer
takeover
.
But
,
in
the
absence
of
their
American
owners
,
Swansea
lost
for
the
12th
time
this
season
and
are
now
four
points
from
safety
having
conceded
28
goals
under
Bradley
.
Swansea
had
the
first
chance
when
Jack
Cork
's
tenacity
gave
Borja
Baston
a
glimpse
of
goal
,
which
he
chose
to
take
rather
than
slip
in
the
fast-supporting
Gylfi
Sigurdsson
.
The
ball
drifted
well
wide
and
Borja
must
have
regretted
his
choice
when
West
Ham
claimed
the
lead
a
minute
later
.
Carroll
always
enjoys
seeing
Swansea
,
having
scored
five
goals
and
had
three
assists
in
his
previous
eight
appearances
against
the
Welsh
club
.
And
the
England
striker
claimed
another
assist
when
he
pulled
on
to
Angel
Rangel
in
the
right-back
position
and
diverted
Mark
Noble
's
centre
across
goal
.
Cheikhou
Kouyate
's
presence
bewitched
Lukasz
Fabianski
at
the
near
post
as
the
goalkeeper
fumbled
the
ball
into
the
path
of
Andre
Ayew
for
the
softest
of
goals
.
Ayew
almost
had
another
from
Dimitri
Payet
's
cross
and
the
anxiety
in
Swansea
ranks
was
quickly
spreading
around
a
stadium
with
each
poor
home
touch
greeted
by
a
chorus
of
groans
.
Payet
was
allowed
to
cut
inside
onto
his
right
foot
to
force
a
goal-line
stop
from
Fabianski
and
it
was
only
a
final
careless
pass
which
prevented
West
Ham
from
doubling
their
advantage
.
Swansea
lacked
the
pace
to
profit
from
their
own
counters
but
Jay
Fulton
and
Rangel
worked
space
well
to
create
a
chance
for
Sigurdsson
.
As
if
to
sum
up
Swansea
's
performance
,
the
usually
reliable
Sigurdsson
mishit
his
attempt
so
badly
it
went
out
for
a
West
Ham
throw
.
Sigurdsson
was
more
accurate
from
a
25-yard
free-kick
,
which
Darren
Randolph
pushed
around
a
post
,
but
the
goalkeeper
waved
over
a
Cork
header
on
the
stroke
of
half-time
.
Swansea
sent
on
Llorente
and
Jefferson
Montero
to
engineer
a
rescue
act
,
but
West
Ham
scored
again
within
four
minutes
of
the
restart
.
Payet
sent
his
corner
towards
the
six-yard
box
and
Reid
got
between
Alfie
Mawson
and
Cork
to
head
home
his
second
goal
of
the
season
.
Swansea
fans
instantly
vented
their
frustration
at
Bradley
and
Jenkins
,
but
Randolph
was
called
upon
to
stop
Wayne
Routledge
and
Sigurdsson
before
West
Ham
sewed
up
matters
.
Fabianski
pushed
aside
Edimilson
Fernandes
'
shot
,
but
Havard
Nordtveit
followed
up
to
drive
the
ball
back
into
the
area
for
Antonio
to
deflect
home
his
eighth
goal
of
the
season
.
Llorente
raised
some
Swansea
cheer
from
close
range
,
but
Carroll
smashed
home
an
angled
volley
moments
later
.
