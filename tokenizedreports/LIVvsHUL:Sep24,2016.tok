Liverpool
run
riot
to
thrash
10-man
Hull
with
James
Milner
brace
An
irrepressible
Liverpool
ran
riot
in
a
5-1
win
against
a
hapless
and
helpless
10-man
Hull
as
the
goals
continued
to
rain
in
at
Anfield
.
James
Milner
scored
two
penalties
,
the
brilliant
performances
of
Philippe
Coutinho
and
Adam
Lallana
were
both
rewarded
with
goals
,
while
Sadio
Mane
was
also
on
the
scoresheet
as
substitute
David
Meyler
converted
the
visitors
'
only
real
chance
.
It
is
early
days
but
nine
goals
in
two
home
appearances
suggest
the
players
are
no
longer
impaired
by
fans
'
expectation
and
the
new-look
old
ground
is
starting
to
resemble
a
fortress
again
.
Of
course
much
of
that
has
to
do
with
the
mentality
created
by
Jurgen
Klopp
.
No
more
so
was
it
highlighted
than
by
the
manager
's
decision
to
drop
long-time
first-choice
goalkeeper
Simon
Mignolet
to
give
summer
signing
Loris
Karius
his
Premier
League
debut
.
The
German
may
not
have
managed
a
clean
sheet
but
on
days
like
these
the
goalkeeper
,
like
most
of
the
ground
,
can
just
stand
and
admire
the
quality
in
front
of
him
.
Klopp
wanted
his
team
to
be
`
angry
'
at
the
thought
Hull
might
come
and
try
to
take
points
off
them
but
it
was
Tigers
caretaker
boss
Mike
Phelan
who
ended
up
being
most
annoyed
.
Joel
Matip
headed
over
and
Coutinho
completely
fluffed
his
kick
five
yards
out
allowing
Ahmed
Elmohamady
to
clear
off
the
line
,
but
that
set
the
tone
for
a
brilliant
19-minute
spell
in
which
Liverpool
were
almost
unplayable
.
Seventeen
minutes
in
Coutinho
picked
up
ball
on
the
left
and
Roberto
Firmino
's
clever
diagonal
dummy
run
across
Hull
's
defence
opened
up
space
for
his
Brazil
team-mate
to
pick
out
Lallana
to
slot
home
inside
the
far
post
.
Elmohamady
had
legitimately
denied
Coutinho
earlier
but
resorted
to
illegal
means
when
he
stuck
out
an
elbow
to
stop
the
playmaker
's
goalbound
shot
,
resulting
in
a
red
card
for
the
defender
and
another
confident
penalty
conversion
from
Milner
.
Mane
,
after
one
shot
deflected
on
to
the
crossbar
,
made
it
3-0
in
the
36th
minute
after
a
trademark
Lallana
turn
earned
the
England
midfielder
enough
space
in
the
penalty
area
to
slide
a
pass
into
his
team-mate
,
who
scored
with
a
shot
on
the
turn
.
The
numerically-disadvantaged
Hull
adopted
a
4-5-0
formation
in
an
attempt
to
stem
the
red
tide
.
They
were
still
carved
open
by
a
brilliant
pass
from
central
defender
Ragnar
Klavan
inside
makeshift
full-back
Meyler
but
no-one
could
get
on
the
end
of
Milner
's
cross
through
the
six-yard
box
,
while
Gini
Wijnaldum
was
denied
at
point-blank
range
by
David
Marshall
.
Phelan
,
`
celebrating
'
his
54th
birthday
,
saw
his
beleaguered
side
pull
one
back
when
Meyler
rammed
home
from
a
corner
just
after
the
break
.
However
,
there
was
no
real
sense
anything
would
change
and
Coutinho
made
sure
of
that
with
a
dipping
20-yard
shot
less
than
60
seconds
later
.
All
this
was
achieved
without
Liverpool
's
premier
striker
Daniel
Sturridge
but
his
arrival
off
the
bench
saw
the
England
international
immediately
draw
a
foul
from
Andrew
Robertson
,
allowing
Milner
to
score
his
second
from
the
spot
and
take
Liverpool
's
tally
to
24
goals
in
eight
matches
this
season
.
