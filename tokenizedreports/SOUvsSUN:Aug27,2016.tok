Southampton
VS
Sunderland
Aug
27
,
2016
Jay
Rodriguez
scores
as
Southampton
draw
with
Sunderland
Jay
Rodriguez
's
first
Premier
League
goal
since
March
2014
salvaged
Southampton
a
1-1
draw
after
Jermain
Defoe
thought
his
penalty
had
handed
Sunderland
a
priceless
away
victory
.
Stand-in
Sunderland
goalkeeper
Jordan
Pickford
's
mistake
gifted
Southampton
the
leveller
,
however
,
as
the
Black
Cats
'
deputy
allowed
Rodriguez
's
strike
to
slip
under
his
body
in
a
cruel
late
blow
.
This
was
Pickford
's
chance
to
come
of
Premier
League
age
after
Vito
Mannone
's
elbow
injury
,
but
the
22-year-old
's
error
proved
very
costly
on
the
south
coast
.
England
forward
Rodriguez
has
spent
the
last
two
years
battling
serious
knee
ligament
trouble
,
and
even
in
midweek
new
Saints
boss
Claude
Puel
suggested
he
could
go
on
loan
for
regular
match
action
.
The
27-year-old
will
insist
his
late
goal
underscores
his
lasting
abilities
however
,
as
he
hit
the
Premier
League
net
for
the
first
time
since
a
brace
in
Southampton
's
4-0
win
over
Newcastle
at
St
Mary
's
on
March
29
,
2014
.
Defoe
's
unrivalled
sharpness
so
nearly
sealed
a
vital
win
on
the
road
for
David
Moyes
'
men
,
but
in
the
end
both
sides
remain
winless
in
the
league
after
three
matches
.
New
Sunderland
boss
Moyes
insisted
Pickford
could
prove
himself
worthy
of
a
regular
run
ahead
of
this
clash
,
with
Mannone
now
out
for
three
months
.
But
the
ex-Manchester
United
and
Everton
manager
may
well
look
to
the
transfer
market
to
add
competition
among
his
goalkeepers
now
,
even
if
Pickford
can
still
have
a
bright
future
.
Southampton
's
neat
start
yielded
no
clear-cut
chances
,
and
after
that
initial
20-minute
dominance
the
first
half
receded
into
mediocrity
.
Tadic
drove
just
over
form
20
yards
,
Austin
forced
Pickford
into
a
smart
save
and
was
then
ruled
offside
when
through
on
goal
.
Lamine
Kone
spurned
the
chance
of
the
half
though
,
heading
way
over
when
criminally
unmarked
in
Southampton
's
box
.
Jack
Rodwell
failed
to
angle
his
approach-play
header
to
a
team-mate
when
Saints
'
defensive
shape
let
them
down
again
in
the
box
just
minutes
later
.
And
then
Fabio
Borini
failed
to
do
justice
to
Patrick
Van
Aanholt
's
fine
inside
ball
,
unable
to
dig
out
a
shot
when
twisting
awkwardly
.
Twice
Lynden
Gooch
picked
Oriol
Romeu
's
pocket
,
hounding
Saints
'
defensive
midfielder
to
fine
effect
.
On
both
occasions
however
the
final
ball
failed
to
match
the
determination
.
Austin
's
galling
afternoon
continued
unabated
,
the
sluggish
striker
falling
prey
to
two
quick
offsides
,
failing
to
capitalise
on
penetrative
approach
play
.
Borini
's
weak
free-kick
failed
to
trouble
Fraser
Forster
in
a
rare
Sunderland
foray
,
before
Redmond
could
not
find
the
finish
to
match
his
scything
run
for
the
hosts
.
The
home
crowd
called
for
the
introduction
of
Shane
Long
,
and
boss
Claude
Puel
duly
obliged
.
Tadic
proved
a
curious
withdrawal
,
when
everyone
expected
Austin
to
receive
the
hook
.
The
former
QPR
hitman
did
indeed
retreat
to
the
bench
soon
afterwards
however
,
Puel
mustering
all
his
firepower
by
sending
Jay
Rodriguez
into
the
fray
.
While
Saints
were
tinkering
however
,
Sunderland
's
far
more
settled
set-up
quickly
paid
big
dividends
.
The
sharpest
striker
on
the
pitch
all
day
,
Defoe
had
just
kicked
himself
for
failing
to
pull
the
trigger
in
the
box
when
another
chance
came
his
way
.
Defoe
so
totally
outfoxed
Jose
Fonte
that
hapless
Saints
'
captain
upended
Sunderland
's
veteran
forward
in
the
box
.
The
wily
Wearside
man
stepped
and
duly
buried
the
resulting
penalty
.
But
just
when
the
visitors
were
dreaming
of
a
precious
away
victory
,
up
stepped
Rodriguez
to
drill
home
thanks
to
Pickford
's
error
.
