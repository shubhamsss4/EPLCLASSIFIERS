Chelsea
humiliate
Manchester
United
on
Jose
Mourinho
return
Jose
Mourinho
endured
a
torrid
return
to
Chelsea
,
watching
his
Manchester
United
side
concede
a
goal
after
30
seconds
as
they
slumped
to
a
4-0
defeat
.
The
former
Chelsea
manager
received
a
respectful
reception
from
the
home
crowd
as
he
emerged
into
the
Stamford
Bridge
arena
prior
to
kick-off
--
but
then
saw
his
players
fall
apart
in
the
opening
moments
.
Marcos
Alonso
lofted
a
pass
forward
,
United
defender
Chris
Smalling
left
it
and
Pedro
pounced
,
taking
the
ball
around
goalkeeper
David
De
Gea
to
sidefoot
home
and
score
the
fastest
goal
of
the
season
so
far
.
Shellshocked
United
briefly
threatened
to
rally
when
Antonio
Valencia
crossed
towards
Zlatan
Ibrahimovic
,
only
for
the
Swede
to
direct
his
header
over
the
crossbar
.
But
the
Blues
were
dominant
,
with
one
corner
scrambled
away
from
the
waiting
Diego
Costa
and
Eden
Hazard
left
free
to
drill
another
wide
from
the
edge
of
the
area
before
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
been
played
.
And
Chelsea
got
the
second
goal
their
pressure
had
merited
with
21
minutes
on
the
clock
as
United
again
looked
horribly
uncertain
at
the
back
.
Another
corner
came
off
Valencia
and
then
hit
Ander
Herrera
before
Gary
Cahill
smashed
a
shot
in
off
Daley
Blind
to
put
the
home
side
in
total
control
.
It
could
have
been
3-0
soon
afterwards
but
De
Gea
made
a
crucial
intervention
to
stop
Pedro
's
cross
reaching
Costa
and
another
teasing
ball
from
Hazard
just
failed
to
fall
for
the
striker
.
United
again
rallied
briefly
and
Chelsea
keeper
Thibaut
Courtois
had
to
be
on
his
toes
to
stop
Ander
Herrera
's
speculative
effort
from
the
edge
of
the
box
and
then
block
Jesse
Lingard
's
angled
follow-up
.
Blues
defender
David
Luiz
was
booked
for
a
high
challenge
on
Marouane
Fellaini
five
minutes
before
the
break
,
and
the
teams
walked
off
with
Mourinho
facing
a
huge
challenge
to
get
anything
from
his
return
to
London
.
The
United
boss
made
a
half-time
change
,
bringing
on
former
Chelsea
midfielder
Juan
Mata
for
Fellaini
and
moving
Rashford
to
a
central
position
alongside
Ibrahimovic
.
Costa
fired
home
after
a
deflected
shot
reached
him
but
was
clearly
offside
and
then
played
a
one-two
with
Hazard
,
who
was
unable
to
reach
the
return
ball
under
pressure
inside
the
United
area
.
When
a
United
attack
broke
down
after
56
minutes
Moses
carried
the
ball
deep
into
the
visitors
'
half
before
playing
in
Hazard
,
whose
effort
crashed
back
off
a
defender
.
Courtois
was
again
on
his
toes
when
Lingard
tried
his
luck
from
distance
,
parrying
the
effort
,
and
as
the
hour
mark
approached
United
began
to
find
more
rhythm
and
pace
to
their
passing
with
Chelsea
beginning
to
sit
deeper
.
But
after
62
minutes
the
Blues
put
the
game
beyond
doubt
when
Eden
Hazard
was
found
in
the
box
by
an
incisive
Nemanja
Matic
pass
and
steered
a
clinical
low
finish
past
De
Gea
and
inside
the
far
post
.
A
forlorn-looking
Mourinho
brought
Antony
Martial
into
the
action
for
Lingard
,
but
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
after
70
minutes
when
N'Golo
Kante
tricked
his
way
into
the
area
amid
more
dreadful
United
defending
and
slid
a
low
finish
beyond
De
Gea
.
Conte
brought
off
Pedro
and
brought
on
Nathaniel
Chalobah
before
Pogba
fired
a
speculative
effort
wide
for
a
thoroughly
demoralised
United
.
A
smart
turn
and
shot
from
Zlatan
Ibrahimovic
could
have
brought
the
scantest
of
consolations
but
Courtois
again
denied
the
visitors
before
Moses
had
an
effort
blocked
as
the
Blues
sought
a
fifth
goal
.
Late
in
injury
time
,
Marcos
Rojo
was
thwarted
by
the
Chelsea
keeper
as
he
tipped
a
powerful
strike
past
the
post
.
