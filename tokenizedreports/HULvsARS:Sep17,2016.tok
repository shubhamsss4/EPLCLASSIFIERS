Alexis
Sanchez
stars
in
Arsenal
four-goal
show
at
Hull
Arsenal
and
Alexis
Sanchez
continued
their
fine
record
against
Hull
as
Arsene
Wenger
's
side
won
a
third
straight
Premier
League
match
for
the
first
time
since
December
.
The
Gunners
were
far
from
convincing
in
a
midweek
Champions
League
draw
at
Paris
Saint-Germain
,
just
days
after
fortuitously
overcoming
Southampton
,
but
matters
were
far
more
comprehensive
at
the
KCOM
Stadium
.
Hull
have
only
beaten
the
Gunners
once
since
1915
and
that
poor
run
was
extended
on
Saturday
,
with
Sanchez
's
double
helping
to
secure
a
4-1
win
against
a
City
side
who
were
reduced
to
10
men
just
before
the
break
after
Jake
Livermore
was
sent
off
.
Sanchez
has
now
scored
six
goals
in
five
matches
in
all
competitions
against
the
Tigers
,
and
got
the
first
of
Saturday
's
contest
early
on
after
directing
home
an
Alex
Iwobi
shot
.
Hull
goalkeeper
Eldin
Jakupovic
should
have
done
better
in
the
build-up
to
the
opener
,
but
went
some
way
to
making
amends
by
denying
Sanchez
from
the
spot
kick
that
followed
Livermore
's
handball
.
The
midfielder-cum-defender
was
perhaps
harshly
sent
off
and
Arsenal
capitalised
10
minutes
after
half-time
,
with
Theo
Walcott
collecting
a
clever
flick
by
the
impressive
Iwobi
to
clip
home
.
Harry
Maguire
could
only
help
the
goal-bound
ball
into
his
own
net
.
Robert
Snodgrass
reduced
the
deficit
late
on
when
referee
Roger
East
awarded
a
penalty
,
but
Sanchez
rifled
home
and
substitute
Granit
Xhaka
opened
his
account
in
stunning
fashion
as
Arsenal
became
the
first
away
side
to
win
six
competitive
matches
at
the
KCOM
Stadium
.
Mike
Phelan
,
still
only
in
caretaker
charge
of
Hull
despite
winning
August
's
manager
of
the
month
award
,
stuck
with
the
same
starting
line-up
that
had
served
him
so
well
this
term
,
while
Petr
Cech
and
Walcott
came
in
for
the
visitors
.
The
latter
was
soon
involved
and
provided
a
cross
from
which
Sanchez
could
only
blaze
over
,
but
a
clumsy
save
from
Jakupovic
allowed
Arsenal
to
strike
the
first
blow
in
the
17th
minute
.
Francis
Coquelin
showed
impressive
awareness
after
his
initial
shot
was
blocked
,
playing
the
ball
to
Santi
Cazorla
rather
than
having
another
effort
.
Walcott
got
away
a
cross-shot
that
Jakupovic
parried
into
the
path
of
Iwobi
,
whose
shot
went
in
off
Sanchez
.
Jakupovic
superbly
stopped
Iwobi
and
watched
Mesut
Ozil
sky
the
rebound
as
Arsenal
dominated
,
with
Abel
Hernandez
's
strike
into
the
side-netting
and
a
tame
Snodgrass
effort
the
best
Hull
could
muster
early
on
.
Home
hopes
of
a
Hull
comeback
faded
as
half-time
approached
,
with
Livermore
adjudged
to
have
purposely
handed
a
Coquelin
shot
.
Referee
East
pointed
to
the
spot
and
sent
Livermore
off
,
much
to
the
former
Tottenham
man
's
shock
and
the
home
fans
'
chagrin
.
Anger
turned
to
relief
as
Jakupovic
got
down
low
to
impressively
save
Sanchez
's
penalty
,
with
the
goalkeeper
earning
more
applause
after
preventing
Ahmed
Elmohamady
from
turning
into
his
own
goal
.
The
applause
made
way
for
boos
at
half-time
as
fans
made
their
anger
clear
to
the
officials
.
Arsenal
made
their
man
advantage
count
in
the
55th
minute
.
Walcott
followed
his
run
after
playing
the
ball
to
Iwobi
,
who
superbly
flicked
on
for
the
England
international
to
clip
home
.
Hernandez
hit
an
acrobatic
effort
off
the
crossbar
,
unaware
offside
had
been
called
,
as
Hull
attempted
to
reduce
the
deficit
-
which
they
managed
to
do
in
the
79th
minute
after
debutant
Dieumerci
Mbokani
was
taken
down
by
Petr
Cech
.
Referee
East
allowed
play
to
continue
but
eventually
pointed
to
the
spot
,
with
Snodgrass
firing
home
emphatically
.
There
was
to
be
no
sustained
comeback
,
though
,
as
Sanchez
restored
Arsenal
's
two-goal
cushion
,
showing
impressive
composure
after
Walcott
was
denied
to
rifle
into
the
top
of
the
net
.
Xhaka
,
brought
on
in
the
67th
minute
,
compounded
matters
in
stoppage
time
.
Taking
aim
from
30
yards
,
the
Swiss
midfielder
's
thumping
left-footed
effort
beat
Jakupovic
.
