Gareth
Barry
scores
on
landmark
appearance
in
Everton
's
win
Midfielder
Gareth
Barry
marked
his
600th
Premier
League
appearance
with
a
goal
as
Everton
's
unbeaten
start
continued
with
a
3-1
win
over
Middlesbrough
that
moved
them
into
second
place
.
The
35-year-old
,
whose
milestone
has
previously
been
achieved
by
only
Ryan
Giggs
-LRB-
632
-RRB-
and
Frank
Lampard
-LRB-
609
-RRB-
,
sparked
the
hosts
'
comeback
after
goalkeeper
Maarten
Stekelenburg
was
controversially
adjudged
to
have
conceded
an
own
goal
from
Alvaro
Negredo
's
robust
,
old-school
centre-forward
's
challenge
.
He
may
be
slower
than
his
more
sprightly
,
younger
compatriots
but
the
cool-headed
Barry
reacted
quickest
to
smash
home
from
a
corner
.
Having
gone
103
matches
without
a
goal
it
was
the
veteran
midfielder
's
second
in
four
matches
.
Full-back
Seamus
Coleman
put
Everton
ahead
with
a
well-worked
second
before
Romelu
Lukaku
made
it
six
goals
in
three
games
for
club
and
country
.
That
made
it
four
wins
and
a
draw
for
manager
Ronald
Koeman
,
another
summer
arrival
,
with
only
Manchester
City
having
a
better
record
.
Barry
was
one
of
two
Everton
midfielders
being
talked
about
pre-match
as
Ross
Barkley
's
indifferent
form
was
another
subject
for
public
debate
.
The
England
international
was
hooked
at
half-time
of
Monday
's
3-0
win
at
Sunderland
with
Koeman
subsequently
telling
the
22-year-old
he
had
to
improve
.
He
kept
his
place
in
the
starting
line-up
but
his
first
real
run
of
any
intent
with
the
ball
saw
him
check
backwards
,
which
had
Koeman
turning
away
in
a
mixture
of
frustration
and
disgust
.
Barkley
was
to
get
better
as
the
match
wore
on
with
one
long-range
drive
parried
by
Victor
Valdes
into
the
path
of
Lukaku
,
who
was
flagged
offside
as
he
collected
the
rebound
.
He
produced
one
brilliant
turn
to
leave
Daniel
Ayala
trailing
in
his
wake
only
to
delay
just
long
enough
for
the
defender
and
his
centre-back
partner
Ben
Gibson
to
get
back
and
snuff
out
the
threat
.
Of
all
the
midfielders
on
show
,
however
,
Everton
's
industrious
Idrissa
Gana
Gueye
is
already
looking
a
snip
at
B7
.1
million
from
Aston
Villa
purely
on
his
work-rate
alone
.
Barry
,
meanwhile
,
was
going
about
his
business
in
the
same
manner
he
had
done
in
599
previous
Premier
League
matches
:
mopping
up
in
midfield
,
keeping
it
simple
and
generally
being
solid
.
That
was
until
Ashley
Williams
got
in
the
way
of
Valdes
at
a
corner
and
Barry
instantly
lashed
home
an
angled
shot
to
make
it
1-1
in
the
22nd
minute
.
If
Middlesbrough
argued
Williams
had
impeded
their
goalkeeper
,
Everton
thought
they
had
an
equally
justifiable
claim
on
the
visitors
'
opener
three
minutes
earlier
when
Negredo
,
dominant
in
the
air
,
appeared
to
head
Stekelenburg
's
hands
and
not
the
ball
,
forcing
the
goalkeeper
to
divert
Stewart
Downing
's
cross
into
his
own
net
.
A
furious
Stekelenburg
,
who
left
himself
open
to
some
criticism
by
not
being
physically
stronger
under
pressure
,
was
booked
for
his
protests
before
Everton
gradually
took
a
hold
of
the
game
,
only
really
making
it
tell
when
they
scored
twice
in
three
minutes
before
the
break
.
The
first
of
those
was
a
smart
move
which
saw
full-back
Coleman
exchange
passes
with
Lukaku
,
cut
across
the
area
before
rolling
a
shot
with
his
weaker
left
foot
past
Valdes
.
Everton
's
third
,
in
added
time
,
had
more
fortune
about
it
as
Yannick
Bolasie
's
inswinging
cross
was
aimed
at
Lukaku
and
the
Belgian
was
deemed
to
have
got
the
slightest
of
touches
to
divert
the
ball
beyond
Valdes
.
Deadline
day
loan
signing
from
West
Ham
Enner
Valencia
was
given
a
second-half
debut
when
Lukaku
took
a
whack
on
his
calf
as
Everton
comfortably
saw
out
the
game
.
