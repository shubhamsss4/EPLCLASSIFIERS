Southampton
VS
Watford

Nathan
Redmond
scores
on
debut
as
Watford
hold
Southampton
Nathan
Redmond
grabbed
a
debut
goal
as
Southampton
came
from
behind
to
snatch
a
1-1
draw
in
the
battle
of
the
new
bosses
.
Watford
chief
Walter
Mazzarri
saw
his
new
side
take
an
early
lead
thanks
to
a
first
Hornets
goal
for
Etienne
Capoue
.
But
Redmond
ensured
Claude
Puel
came
away
with
a
point
from
his
first
game
in
charge
of
Southampton
,
while
Watford
played
the
final
15
minutes
a
man
down
after
Ben
Watson
's
dismissal
.
The
opening
day
often
throws
up
the
odd
surprise
and
the
identity
of
Watford
's
goalscorer
was
certainly
one
of
them
.
Despite
his
attacking
tendencies
Capoue
did
not
find
the
net
once
last
season
,
much
to
the
amusement
of
his
team-mates
,
but
the
former
Tottenham
midfielder
took
just
nine
minutes
to
get
off
the
mark
this
term
.
Southampton
's
defending
was
a
major
strong
point
under
previous
boss
Ronald
Koeman
but
it
was
non-existent
as
Nordin
Amrabat
lifted
a
cross
towards
Troy
Deeney
at
the
far
post
.
Deeney
was
unmarked
as
he
nodded
the
ball
down
towards
Capoue
,
who
took
advantage
of
Oriel
Romeu
's
ball-watching
to
lash
his
shot
past
Fraser
Forster
.
By
then
Saints
would
have
already
been
ahead
but
for
a
stunning
double
save
from
Hornets
keeper
Heurelho
Gomes
.
Dusan
Tadic
rifled
in
a
20-yard
free-kick
which
was
pushed
away
by
the
Brazilian
,
who
then
got
up
in
time
to
produce
another
fine
block
to
prevent
a
Miguel
Britos
own-goal
.
After
Capoue
's
strike
Southampton
spent
the
rest
of
the
first
period
camped
in
Watford
's
half
but
Shane
Long
headed
a
Tadic
cross
off
target
and
Portugal
full-back
Cedric
Soares
had
a
fierce
drive
beaten
away
by
Gomes
.
After
the
interval
James
Ward-Prowse
's
shot
was
deflected
narrowly
wide
before
Redmond
forced
Gomes
to
tip
his
curling
effort
inches
past
the
far
post
.
But
from
the
corner
the
summer
signing
from
Norwich
notched
his
deserved
debut
goal
.
Gomes
came
out
to
punch
the
cross
clear
,
only
to
send
it
looping
high
in
the
air
towards
Redmond
who
volleyed
it
straight
back
past
the
keeper
and
into
the
net
.
Watford
sub
Watson
rightly
saw
red
15
minutes
from
time
after
cynically
tugging
back
Long
as
the
striker
raced
through
on
goal
.
Redmond
's
afternoon
almost
got
even
better
with
five
minutes
left
when
he
slotted
home
what
would
surely
have
been
the
winner
,
only
to
be
denied
by
a
narrow
offside
decision
.
