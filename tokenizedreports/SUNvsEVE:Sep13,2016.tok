Romelu
Lukaku
scores
11-minute
hat
trick
in
Everton
defeat
of
Sunderland
Romelu
Lukaku
ended
an
11-game
Premier
League
drought
in
style
with
an
11-minute
hat-trick
as
he
fired
Everton
to
a
3-0
victory
at
Sunderland
.
The
Belgium
international
struck
with
60th
and
68th-minute
headers
and
then
completed
his
treble
with
19
minutes
remaining
at
the
Stadium
of
Light
to
condemn
former
Toffees
boss
David
Moyes
,
who
lost
his
job
as
Manchester
United
manager
after
a
defeat
by
the
same
opposition
in
April
2014
,
to
a
third
defeat
in
four
league
outings
so
far
this
season
.
Sunderland
gave
as
good
as
they
got
before
the
break
despite
having
to
defend
resiliently
,
but
they
were
torn
apart
after
it
as
Lukaku
ran
riot
in
front
of
a
largely
horrified
crowd
of
42,406
.
With
Gareth
Barry
and
Ross
Barkley
providing
the
ammunition
for
30million
summer
signing
Yannick
Bolasie
to
feed
Lukaku
,
Everton
were
a
threat
early
on
,
but
with
Sunderland
keeper
Jordan
Pickford
in
fine
form
and
defenders
Papy
Djilobodji
and
Patrick
van
Aanholt
in
determined
mood
,
the
Black
Cats
held
firm
in
the
face
of
a
determined
onslaught
.
Pickford
had
to
dive
bravely
at
Lukaku
's
feet
within
seconds
of
the
start
after
Bolasie
had
fired
in
a
low
cross
,
but
Sunderland
might
have
taken
a
10th-minute
lead
when
Adnan
Januzaj
's
shot
was
blocked
and
looped
perfectly
into
the
path
of
Jermain
Defoe
,
who
for
once
sent
his
first-time
volley
over
the
bar
.
However
,
Pickford
had
to
pull
off
a
breathtaking
one-handed
save
to
keep
out
Lukaku
's
bullet
header
from
a
13th-minute
Bolasie
cross
,
and
the
striker
stumbled
as
he
turned
Djilobodji
from
Barkley
's
pass
six
minutes
later
and
could
only
prod
the
ball
straight
at
the
keeper
.
Lynden
Gooch
almost
caught
Everton
keeper
Maarten
Stekelenburg
napping
with
a
curling
effort
which
might
have
crept
under
his
crossbar
had
he
not
got
his
fingertips
to
it
five
minutes
before
the
break
,
but
Bolasie
smashed
a
rising
drive
just
over
on
the
stroke
of
half-time
.
Everton
boss
Ronald
Koeman
replaced
Barkley
with
Gerard
Deulofeu
at
the
break
and
the
newcomer
made
an
instant
impact
with
a
surging
run
which
eventually
led
to
Leighton
Baines
picking
out
Bolasie
,
who
cut
inside
from
the
left
to
force
a
diving
save
from
Pickford
.
But
Sunderland
responded
and
after
Ashley
Williams
had
blocked
Defoe
's
51st-minute
shot
behind
,
Lamine
Kone
headed
powerfully
at
Stekelenburg
from
the
resulting
corner
with
the
keeper
needing
two
attempts
to
claim
the
ball
.
Lukaku
stabbed
inches
wide
from
Seamus
Coleman
's
driven
54th-minute
cross
,
but
he
found
the
target
five
minutes
later
when
,
after
Deulofeu
had
broken
at
pace
from
a
Sunderland
corner
,
Idrissa
Gueye
crossed
from
the
right
and
he
rose
unopposed
to
head
past
the
helpless
Pickford
.
The
Belgian
rattled
the
crossbar
after
turning
smartly
four
minutes
later
,
but
made
sure
of
victory
with
23
minutes
remaining
when
Bolasie
picked
him
out
unmarked
at
the
far
post
once
again
.
The
home
side
's
misery
was
complete
within
three
minutes
when
the
powerhouse
striker
helped
himself
to
a
third
after
Kevin
Mirallas
had
played
him
through
on
Pickford
.
