Apr

2017
Everton
end
Leicester
's
winning
run
in
six-goal
thriller
Romelu
Lukaku
's
good
form
in
front
of
goal
at
Goodison
Park
continued
with
a
double
as
Everton
's
4-2
victory
over
Leicester
ended
Foxes
boss
Craig
Shakespeare
's
six-game
winning
run
.
Lukaku
maintained
his
run
of
scoring
in
every
home
match
in
2017
,
a
streak
he
extended
to
eight
games
as
he
took
his
Premier
League
tally
to
23
goals
,
one
more
than
Middlesbrough
's
total
for
the
entire
season
.
It
was
already
2-1
to
Leicester
by
the
time
he
scored
his
first
after
a
pulsating
opening
10
minutes
when
Tom
Davies
,
Islam
Slimani
and
Marc
Albrighton
all
netted
,
with
Lukaku
then
levelling
and
later
grabbing
the
Toffees
'
fourth
after
Phil
Jagielka
restored
their
lead
before
half-time
.
This
was
the
first
time
Leicester
had
failed
to
win
since
Shakespeare
took
over
from
Claudio
Ranieri
in
February
,
though
in
making
five
changes
to
his
starting
XI
he
showed
he
was
clearly
prioritising
Wednesday
's
trip
to
Atletico
Madrid
in
the
Champions
League
quarterfinals
.
With
parts
of
the
country
enjoying
the
warmest
day
of
the
year
,
there
may
have
been
fears
for
this
becoming
a
Sunday
afternoon
stroll
,
yet
all
of
that
was
dispelled
inside
a
frantic
opening
spell
.
Thirty
seconds
in
and
Everton
were
ahead
through
Davies
,
who
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
referee
Robert
Madley
.
He
held
off
blowing
his
whistle
when
Daniel
Amartey
pulled
down
Kevin
Mirallas
,
allowing
Davies
the
advantage
to
side-step
Robert
Huth
and
fire
the
hosts
ahead
.
Yet
Leicester
were
soon
in
front
.
They
levelled
via
a
classic
counter-attack
,
Demarai
Gray
striding
from
one
penalty
box
to
the
other
on
a
three-on-two
break
and
slipping
in
Slimani
to
put
through
Joel
Robles
'
legs
.
Confusion
between
unfamiliar
central
defensive
partners
Jagielka
and
Matthew
Pennington
made
Gray
's
choice
easy
and
the
latter
's
clumsy
foul
on
Jamie
Vardy
then
earned
the
Foxes
a
10th-minute
free
kick
.
From
there
the
blame
could
only
lie
with
Robles
as
he
was
deceived
by
Albrighton
's
delivery
from
the
side
of
the
box
which
bent
into
the
top
corner
.
The
pace
barely
slowed
and
the
hosts
had
levelled
before
the
half
's
midway
point
.
Ross
Barkley
,
so
often
guilty
of
taking
an
extra
touch
,
for
once
whipped
in
an
early
cross
that
Lukaku
nodded
in
for
his
customary
Goodison
Park
goal
.
A
score
of
2-2
never
looked
like
being
the
eventual
outcome
and
Ronald
Koeman
's
side
were
in
front
again
prior
to
the
interval
.
It
looked
like
it
would
be
Barkley
who
grabbed
their
third
when
the
ball
rolled
into
his
path
following
Davies
'
tackle
on
Vardy
,
yet
Kasper
Schmeichel
managed
to
deny
the
midfielder
as
he
rounded
him
.
It
mattered
little
,
though
,
as
from
Mirallas
'
corner
Jagielka
rose
highest
to
head
home
.
Unsurprisingly
the
pace
slowed
somewhat
,
although
the
visitors
almost
levelled
when
Slimani
's
cross
was
deflected
into
the
side-netting
.
But
the
second
half
was
only
12
minutes
old
when
Everton
scored
again
through
Lukaku
.
It
was
another
Mirallas
corner
directed
towards
Jagielka
,
and
when
his
header
rebounded
off
Andy
King
,
it
came
to
Lukaku
to
slam
in
.
His
goals
tally
is
now
four
better
than
nearest
golden
boot
pursuer
Harry
Kane
.
That
was
the
sign
for
Shakespeare
to
bring
on
Riyad
Mahrez
as
part
of
a
double
change
,
but
in
doing
so
he
withdrew
Vardy
in
an
indication
matters
in
Madrid
were
still
occupying
his
thoughts
.
He
even
gave
Leonardo
Ulloa
a
first
league
outing
since
Jan.
2
and
was
almost
rewarded
when
he
nearly
scored
with
his
first
touch
from
a
header
that
hit
Idrissa
Gueye
in
the
face
.
Ulloa
seemed
intent
on
marking
his
rare
outing
with
a
goal
as
Robles
saved
another
of
his
headers
,
but
he
was
unable
to
prevent
Leicester
from
sliding
to
their
first
loss
under
Shakespeare
,
whose
attention
now
turns
to
the
club
's
first
Champions
League
quarterfinal
tie
.
