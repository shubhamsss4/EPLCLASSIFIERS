Bojan
Krkic
nets
equaliser
as
Stoke
City
draw
with
West
Ham
Stoke
denied
West
Ham
a
third
straight
victory
at
the
London
Stadium
after
substitute
Bojan
Krkic
's
strike
secured
a
1-1
draw
.
The
hosts
looked
to
be
heading
for
a
much-needed
victory
after
Glenn
Whelan
's
second-half
own
goal
.
But
erratic
goalkeeping
from
Adrian
then
led
to
Stoke
's
equaliser
,
taking
the
visitors
up
to
11th
in
the
Premier
League
and
leaving
16th-placed
West
Ham
just
four
points
off
the
bottom
three
.
An
underwhelming
opening
half
belied
the
fact
that
,
after
each
of
these
teams
experienced
difficult
starts
to
the
season
,
their
results
had
recently
improved
.
Defeat
in
their
most
recent
fixture
,
at
Everton
,
had
ended
the
hosts
'
run
of
three
consecutive
wins
,
while
Stoke
had
won
their
past
three
and
not
lost
in
five
.
Any
sense
of
momentum
,
however
,
was
largely
absent
.
Only
a
27th-minute
header
from
West
Ham
's
Angelo
Ogbonna
--
well
saved
by
Lee
Grant
--
and
Dimitri
Payet
's
narrowly-off-target
free-kick
on
the
stroke
of
half-time
left
any
impression
.
The
second
half
started
at
a
similarly
pedestrian
pace
,
with
both
sides
appearing
short
of
confidence
and
unwilling
to
take
the
sort
of
risks
which
might
have
brought
the
game
to
life
.
Phil
Bardsley
,
with
a
powerful-but-optimistic
40-yard
strike
that
went
over
the
crossbar
,
had
provided
the
only
further
attacking
threat
when
Slaven
Bilic
was
rewarded
for
making
a
double
substitution
.
The
manager
removed
the
largely-anonymous
Manuel
Lanzini
and
Andre
Ayew
,
replacing
them
with
Ashley
Fletcher
and
Edimilson
Fernandes
,
and
a
goal
almost
instantly
followed
.
Taking
advantage
of
space
on
the
left
wing
,
Payet
sent
a
65th-minute
cross
towards
Antonio
,
who
with
his
back
to
goal
headed
against
Whelan
,
taking
the
ball
beyond
the
diving
Grant
into
the
far-left
post
in
one
of
few
positive
contributions
the
day
before
Gareth
Southgate
's
latest
England
squad
is
announced
.
Perhaps
inspired
by
his
opposite
number
,
Mark
Hughes
then
removed
Wilfried
Bony
and
Whelan
for
Peter
Crouch
and
Bojan
,
and
Stoke
similarly
responded
by
drawing
level
four
minutes
later
.
A
pass
from
Charlie
Adam
had
put
Jon
Walters
into
space
,
and
oddly
prompted
West
Ham
's
Adrian
to
rush
out
of
goal
.
The
forward
took
advantage
by
chipping
the
ball
over
the
goalkeeper
,
and
from
there
the
turning
Bojan
was
first
to
reach
it
and
send
a
classy
finish
into
the
near-open
goal
.
In
one
last
attempt
at
goal
and
when
Adrian
again
appeared
uncertain
,
Adam
tested
the
goalkeeper
with
a
late
free-kick
,
but
he
unconvincingly
turned
it
around
the
post
to
ensure
a
point
.
