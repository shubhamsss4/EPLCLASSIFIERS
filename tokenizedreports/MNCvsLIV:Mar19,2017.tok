Sergio
Aguero
saves
point
for
Man
City
against
Liverpool
Manchester
City
and
Liverpool
had
to
settle
for
a
point
each
in
their
battle
for
Champions
League
qualification
after
a
thrilling
1-1
draw
at
the
Etihad
Stadium
.
Former
City
player
James
Milner
put
Liverpool
ahead
in
a
ferocious
,
end-to-end
Premier
League
contest
with
a
51st-minute
penalty
but
Sergio
Aguero
's
25th
goal
of
the
season
earned
City
a
share
of
the
spoils
.
Both
sides
had
numerous
chances
to
score
a
winner
with
City
,
responding
well
after
their
Champions
League
loss
in
Monaco
,
going
closest
when
Kevin
De
Bruyne
hit
the
post
.
Aguero
also
had
two
more
good
late
chances
while
,
earlier
,
City
's
Willy
Caballero
had
been
the
busier
of
the
two
goalkeepers
.
The
first
half
,
which
started
in
heavy
rain
,
was
open
,
fast-paced
and
keenly
fought
.
Both
teams
showed
a
determination
to
attack
while
some
of
the
challenges
were
fierce
.
Yaya
Toure
received
a
yellow
card
for
catching
Emre
Can
on
the
shoulder
with
his
studs
as
he
slid
in
,
while
emotions
also
ran
high
on
the
touchline
.
Opposing
managers
Pep
Guardiola
and
Jurgen
Klopp
,
both
soaking
wet
,
argued
over
one
of
a
number
of
debatable
decisions
by
referee
Michael
Oliver
,
although
they
ended
the
row
with
a
warm
high-five
.
With
David
Silva
pulling
the
strings
,
City
made
the
best
of
the
early
running
although
Raheem
Sterling
's
eagerness
to
shine
against
his
former
club
saw
him
stray
offside
several
times
.
Simon
Mignolet
turned
a
dangerous
low
ball
from
De
Bruyne
behind
and
Silva
smashed
a
good
chance
narrowly
wide
.
City
had
penalty
appeals
rejected
after
Aguero
went
down
following
attention
from
Joel
Matip
and
when
Sterling
claimed
he
was
clipped
by
Milner
as
he
looked
to
strike
from
close
range
.
In
the
latter
instance
,
City
could
still
have
taken
the
lead
as
the
ball
ran
on
to
Fernandinho
but
the
Brazilian
shot
wide
.
Liverpool
were
also
denied
spot-kicks
after
Sadio
Mane
went
down
following
contact
with
Nicolas
Otamendi
and
Georginio
Wijnaldum
thought
he
was
tripped
.
Roberto
Firmino
and
Adam
Lallana
then
both
forced
good
saves
from
Caballero
before
John
Stones
did
well
to
block
a
shot
on
the
turn
from
Matip
.
Liverpool
were
awarded
a
penalty
early
in
the
second
half
after
Gael
Clichy
was
adjudged
to
have
bundled
Firmino
over
.
City
protested
,
and
continued
to
complain
long
after
Milner
had
struck
,
but
Oliver
stuck
by
his
decision
.
Liverpool
picked
holes
in
the
City
defence
but
Guardiola
then
decided
to
replace
the
tiring
Toure
--
restored
after
being
surprisingly
left
out
in
midweek
--
with
Bacary
Sagna
and
move
starting
right-back
Fernandinho
into
midfield
.
The
equaliser
came
soon
after
as
De
Bruyne
found
space
on
the
right
and
curled
in
a
dangerous
low
ball
for
Aguero
to
clip
home
from
six
yards
.
City
pressed
again
and
De
Bruyne
fired
against
the
post
after
Aguero
lost
his
balance
looking
to
shoot
himself
.
Liverpool
should
have
scored
11
minutes
from
time
when
Firmino
got
behind
the
defence
to
tee
up
Lallana
but
the
England
man
,
wide
open
as
City
wrongly
assumed
he
was
offside
,
missed
his
kick
.
As
the
drama
continued
,
Sterling
poked
narrowly
wide
as
he
latched
onto
a
brilliant
ball
from
Silva
and
Firmino
drove
another
effort
wide
.
Aguero
could
have
had
the
final
word
but
twice
missed
the
target
late
on
.
