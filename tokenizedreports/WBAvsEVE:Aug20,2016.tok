West
Bromwich
Albion
VS
Everton
Aug
20
,
2016
Everton
recover
from
early
setback
to
win
at
West
Brom
Ronald
Koeman
got
his
first
Premier
League
victory
as
Everton
manager
as
his
side
came
from
a
goal
down
to
beat
West
Brom
2-1
at
The
Hawthorns
.
The
Baggies
made
the
perfect
start
to
their
home
campaign
as
Gareth
McAuley
headed
them
into
an
early
lead
.
However
,
goals
from
Kevin
Mirallas
and
Gareth
Barry
either
side
of
half-time
saw
Koeman
claim
his
first
three-point
haul
as
Toffees
boss
after
the
1-1
draw
at
home
to
Tottenham
on
the
opening
day
.
West
Brom
's
opening
goal
came
after
eight
minutes
following
some
good
forward
play
from
Salomon
Rondon
,
who
held
off
Ramiro
Funes
Mori
and
controlled
Craig
Gardner
's
long
ball
into
the
box
before
getting
in
a
shot
that
Maarten
Stekelenburg
did
well
to
block
.
From
the
resulting
corner
,
an
inswinger
from
Gardner
,
McAuley
jumped
highest
between
Mirallas
and
Phil
Jagielka
to
head
home
at
the
far
post
from
two
yards
out
.
Everton
struggled
to
muster
a
response
until
midway
through
the
first
half
when
a
low
cross
from
Leighton
Baines
found
Barry
arriving
just
inside
the
penalty
area
,
but
he
fired
his
shot
tamely
at
Ben
Foster
.
As
the
half-hour
approached
,
former
Albion
loanee
Romelu
Lukaku
received
a
warm
round
of
applause
from
some
of
the
home
fans
as
he
warmed
up
on
the
touchline
--
and
after
37
minutes
he
was
on
the
pitch
in
place
of
James
McCarthy
in
what
looked
like
a
tactical
switch
by
Koeman
.
Lukaku
was
not
directly
involved
but
the
switch
did
quickly
bring
a
reward
as
Everton
equalised
in
the
final
minute
of
the
half
when
a
lovely
one-touch
passing
move
started
by
Mirallas
and
involving
Barry
and
Ross
Barkley
was
given
the
finish
it
deserved
by
the
little
Belgian
when
Mirallas
beat
Foster
from
12
yards
out
.
The
second
half
began
with
a
series
of
chances
for
either
side
to
take
the
lead
before
Everton
eventually
obliged
on
the
hour
.
West
Brom
would
have
regained
the
advantage
had
Stekelenburg
not
stuck
out
his
right
foot
to
block
Darren
Fletcher
's
shot
from
inside
the
box
,
while
Foster
kept
the
scores
level
as
he
instinctively
blocked
Gerard
Deulofeu
's
prod
goalwards
following
an
Everton
corner
.
Gardner
then
curled
a
free-kick
narrowly
wide
before
Foster
had
to
push
away
a
Funes
Mori
header
.
From
the
resulting
corner
,
Mason
Holgate
's
scuffed
volley
looped
towards
the
far
post
where
Barry
,
on
his
100th
Premier
League
appearance
for
the
Toffees
,
headed
home
.
Barkley
should
have
extended
the
lead
after
72
minutes
but
powered
a
near-post
header
wide
from
a
pinpoint
cross
by
substitute
Yannick
Bolasie
,
making
his
debut
following
his
arrival
from
Crystal
Palace
.
Lukaku
was
denied
a
late
goal
by
Foster
on
his
return
when
through
on
the
home
goalkeeper
,
while
a
last-gasp
chance
to
earn
West
Brom
a
point
was
put
over
the
bar
by
Rondon
.
