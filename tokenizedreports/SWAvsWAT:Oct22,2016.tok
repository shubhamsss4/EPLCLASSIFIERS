Swansea
City
play
out
stalemate
against
Watford
Swansea
were
unable
to
mark
Bob
Bradley
's
first
home
game
with
victory
as
Watford
held
them
to
a
goalless
draw
at
the
Liberty
Stadium
.
The
result
leaves
Swansea
in
the
Premier
League
's
relegation
zone
,
but
new
manager
Bradley
will
be
able
to
draw
positives
from
a
performance
which
almost
saw
one
point
turned
into
three
when
Gylfi
Sigurdsson
struck
a
post
late
on
.
This
was
Swansea
's
first
clean
sheet
since
the
opening
day
of
the
season
and
there
was
plenty
of
attacking
intent
,
particularly
in
the
second
half
when
,
unlike
in
the
final
days
of
Francesco
Guidolin
's
managerial
reign
,
they
kept
the
foot
on
the
accelerator
.
But
Watford
are
made
of
stern
stuff
under
Walter
Mazzari
and
the
Hornets
'
record
now
stands
at
one
defeat
in
six
games
after
a
resilient
defensive
display
in
which
Younes
Kaboul
and
goalkeeper
Heurelho
Gomes
were
exceptional
.
Swansea
were
playing
their
100th
Premier
League
game
at
the
Liberty
Stadium
and
they
could
take
encouragement
from
the
fact
Watford
had
not
taken
three
points
in
this
corner
of
south
Wales
since
1983
.
Bradley
also
saw
his
new
charges
start
at
a
good
tempo
,
even
if
chances
were
hard
to
fashion
against
Hornets
'
opponents
fresh
from
keeping
their
first
clean
sheet
in
13
games
at
Middlesbrough
.
Gomes
felt
he
had
to
help
Modou
Barrow
's
effort
around
a
post
,
despite
it
appearing
to
be
veering
away
from
goal
,
and
the
Watford
defence
was
opened
up
by
an
incisive
passing
move
before
the
final
ball
was
placed
too
far
in
front
of
Borja
Baston
.
Sigurdsson
had
a
sight
of
goal
after
Kyle
Naughton
robbed
Troy
Deeney
and
played
a
square
ball
into
his
path
,
but
Gomes
was
equal
to
the
Icelander
's
20-yard
shot
and
caught
the
ball
comfortably
.
Watford
looked
for
the
link-up
play
between
Deeney
and
Odion
Ighalo
whenever
they
could
and
Swansea
's
new
central
defensive
axis
of
Mike
van
der
Hoorn
and
debutant
Alfie
Mawson
had
to
remain
vigilant
.
But
Watford
's
first-half
threat
amounted
to
free-kicks
from
Etienne
Capoue
and
Kaboul
,
neither
of
which
tested
Lukasz
Fabianski
in
the
Swansea
goal
.
Swansea
were
keen
to
utilise
Barrow
's
pace
after
the
restart
and
the
signs
were
positive
as
the
Gambian
combined
well
with
right-back
Naughton
and
began
to
attack
Jose
Holebas
down
the
flank
.
Naughton
's
cross
set
up
an
audacious
overhead
kick
from
Borja
which
sailed
harmlessly
wide
and
the
decibel
levels
rose
as
Sigurdsson
found
space
to
deliver
a
shot
blocked
by
Valon
Behrami
.
But
Watford
were
a
threat
on
the
break
and
Naughton
twice
got
in
the
way
after
Ighalo
tricked
his
way
into
the
box
.
The
deadlock
was
almost
broken
after
64
minutes
when
Sigurdsson
whipped
in
a
free-kick
and
Gomes
denied
Van
der
Hoorn
with
his
legs
from
a
few
yards
out
,
although
how
much
the
Brazilian
knew
about
it
was
open
to
debate
.
Sigurdsson
himself
was
unable
to
convert
an
excellent
opening
from
Barrow
's
cross
and
,
although
the
winner
did
not
come
,
it
did
put
to
an
end
Swansea
's
run
of
four
straight
defeats
.
