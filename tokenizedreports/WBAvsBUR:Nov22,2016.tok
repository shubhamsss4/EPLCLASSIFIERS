West
Bromwich
Albion
VS
Burnley
Nov
22
,
2016
West
Brom
storm
out
of
gates
on
way
to
rout
of
Burnley
West
Brom
blitzed
Burnley
with
three
first-half
goals
before
going
on
to
equal
their
biggest-ever
victory
under
Tony
Pulis
.
The
Baggies
beat
West
Ham
4-0
in
February
2015
,
the
month
after
Pulis
'
arrival
as
head
coach
,
and
they
repeated
the
feat
on
Monday
night
to
climb
up
to
ninth
place
in
the
Premier
League
table
.
Matt
Phillips
struck
after
only
four
minutes
and
when
James
Morrison
doubled
the
lead
with
16
minutes
on
the
clock
it
was
clear
that
Sean
Dyche
's
50th
Premier
League
match
as
Burnley
boss
would
be
one
to
remember
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
.
Darren
Fletcher
effectively
ensured
all
three
points
and
successive
league
wins
for
West
Brom
for
the
first
time
since
the
turn
of
the
year
with
a
third
goal
just
before
half-time
.
Salomon
Rondon
got
the
goal
his
performance
deserved
in
the
second
half
to
complete
the
rout
and
Pulis
could
even
afford
the
luxury
of
taking
off
the
Venezuela
international
with
12
minutes
remaining
to
give
him
extra
rest
ahead
of
the
trip
to
Hull
at
the
weekend
.
West
Brom
,
unchanged
after
winning
at
champions
Leicester
prior
to
the
international
break
,
made
the
perfect
start
.
Dean
Marney
tried
to
cut
out
a
low
Morrison
cross
into
the
penalty
area
,
but
poked
the
ball
straight
to
Phillips
on
the
edge
of
the
six-yard
box
and
he
was
able
to
turn
away
from
Ben
Mee
and
find
the
yard
of
space
he
needed
to
fire
a
rising
shot
into
the
roof
of
the
net
.
Immediately
afterwards
Tom
Heaton
,
one
of
two
England
goalkeepers
on
duty
with
Ben
Foster
in
opposition
,
smothered
a
volley
from
Chris
Brunt
as
the
hosts
piled
on
the
pressure
during
the
opening
stages
.
However
,
Burnley
might
have
equalised
after
13
minutes
following
a
well-worked
free-kick
routine
.
Steven
Defour
's
cross
to
the
edge
of
the
box
was
helped
on
by
Mee
towards
the
penalty
spot
,
where
Sam
Vokes
headed
the
ball
down
for
Jeff
Hendrick
,
but
the
Clarets
'
record
signing
lifted
his
finish
wide
.
It
proved
costly
as
Morrison
soon
extended
West
Brom
's
lead
.
A
Burnley
attack
was
broken
up
on
the
edge
of
his
own
area
by
Brunt
,
who
then
played
a
long
pass
forward
to
the
feet
of
Rondon
just
inside
the
Burnley
half
.
The
Venezuela
international
laid
the
ball
off
for
Morrison
and
he
advanced
toward
goal
before
stroking
a
shot
into
the
bottom
corner
of
the
net
from
18
yards
.
It
should
have
been
3-0
when
Heaton
inexplicably
gave
the
ball
away
to
Morrison
,
but
he
lost
his
balance
and
scuffed
his
shot
wide
under
pressure
from
Hendrick
.
Rondon
was
a
handful
for
the
Burnley
back
four
and
had
two
chances
either
side
of
the
half-hour
mark
to
deservedly
get
his
name
on
the
scores
sheet
.
First
he
powered
an
effort
narrowly
over
the
crossbar
from
the
left
side
of
the
area
and
then
forced
Heaton
into
a
superb
fingertip
save
with
a
curling
effort
which
was
headed
for
the
top
corner
of
the
net
.
West
Brom
did
get
their
third
goal
after
37
minutes
.
Good
wing
play
from
Phillips
saw
him
get
past
right-back
Matt
Lowton
inside
the
area
and
stand
up
a
cross
to
the
far
post
,
where
Fletcher
tapped
the
ball
in
from
three
yards
out
.
Pulis
'
team
were
in
the
comfort
zone
a
little
and
did
not
create
as
much
after
the
break
.
Gareth
McAuley
nearly
marked
his
100th
Premier
League
appearance
for
the
club
with
a
goal
but
his
header
went
wide
.
Rondon
extended
the
lead
after
64
minutes
when
he
controlled
Allan
Nyom
's
cut
back
and
shot
on
the
turn
,
with
the
ball
taking
a
slight
nick
off
a
Burnley
defender
en
route
into
the
net
.
Foster
,
largely
a
spectator
in
the
cold
and
rain
,
had
his
palms
warmed
by
a
Johann
Berg
Gudmundsson
effort
which
he
gathered
at
the
second
attempt
before
having
to
help
a
free
kick
from
the
Icelander
over
the
crossbar
.
West
Brom
substitute
Craig
Gardner
came
close
to
adding
a
fifth
goal
in
injury
time
,
but
Heaton
tipped
his
long
range
strike
round
a
post
.
