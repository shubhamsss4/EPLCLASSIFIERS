victory
Liverpool
returned
to
the
top
of
the
Premier
League
with
a
2-0
win
over
Sunderland
at
Anfield
in
a
game
overshadowed
by
injury
to
Philippe
Coutinho
.
Divock
Origi
's
first
Premier
League
goal
since
April
and
a
late
James
Milner
penalty
saw
Liverpool
return
to
winning
ways
.
Belgium
striker
Origi
was
only
on
the
pitch
because
of
a
potentially
serious
ankle
injury
to
playmaker
Coutinho
,
who
left
the
field
on
a
stretcher
with
his
right
leg
in
a
protective
splint
.
Sunderland
made
things
tough
for
Liverpool
and
frustrations
were
beginning
to
grow
until
Origi
struck
in
the
75th
minute
.
Milner
's
90th-minute
penalty
made
the
result
safe
and
put
an
end
to
the
visitors
'
mini-revival
after
back-to-back
wins
had
lifted
them
off
the
foot
of
the
table
.
The
visitors
conceded
78
percent
of
possession
but
in
the
opening
45
minutes
limited
their
hosts
to
a
handful
of
half-chances
as
Georginio
Wijnaldum
's
early
shot
on
the
turn
was
easily
saved
,
Dejan
Lovren
directed
two
efforts
off
target
and
Sadio
Mane
fired
straight
at
Jordan
Pickford
.
Part
of
Sunderland
's
success
in
negating
the
threat
of
opponents
who
had
scored
17
times
in
five
previous
home
league
matches
was
Jason
Denayer
's
man-marking
job
on
playmaker
Coutinho
.
But
the
one
occasion
the
on-loan
Manchester
City
defender
lost
his
man
resulted
in
Coutinho
's
injury
,
as
Didier
Ndong
's
challenge
caught
the
right
foot
of
the
forward
as
he
tried
to
jink
past
him
.
Sunderland
's
one
chance
before
the
break
fell
to
former
Everton
midfielder
Steven
Pienaar
but
goalkeeper
Loris
Karius
got
out
to
block
.
In
the
second
half
Wijnaldum
bundled
a
volley
wide
,
Roberto
Firmino
was
denied
by
Pickford
at
his
near
post
and
Emre
Can
missed
the
target
as
Sunderland
became
even
more
defensive
.
When
Firmino
flashed
a
cross
through
the
six-yard
box
neither
Origi
nor
Mane
could
apply
the
finishing
touch
,
but
their
frustration
finally
ended
15
minutes
from
time
.
Jordan
Henderson
picked
out
Origi
on
the
left
of
the
penalty
area
and
he
managed
to
thread
a
shot
across
a
crowded
box
and
inside
the
far
post
.
When
the
charging
Mane
was
brought
down
by
Ndong
in
added
time
,
Milner
stepped
up
to
score
his
fifth
of
the
season
.
