City
Oct

,
2016
Chelsea
ease
past
Leicester
with
Costa
,
Hazard
,
Moses
scoring
Diego
Costa
,
Eden
Hazard
and
Victor
Moses
were
all
on
target
for
Chelsea
as
they
brushed
aside
Leicester
City
with
a
3-0
victory
at
Stamford
Bridge
.
Costa
and
Hazard
bagged
first-half
goals
while
Moses
scored
late
on
for
the
Blues
,
who
were
good
value
for
the
win
and
took
control
of
the
game
from
the
off
as
Premier
League
champions
Leicester
failed
to
create
much
of
note
throughout
.
Chelsea
raced
into
the
lead
inside
just
seven
minutes
as
Nemanja
Matic
flicked
on
a
corner
at
the
near
post
,
with
Costa
arriving
unmarked
in
the
middle
to
fire
past
Kasper
Schmeichel
for
his
seventh
Premier
League
goal
of
the
season
.
And
the
Blues
kept
up
the
momentum
following
their
opener
as
they
continued
to
dominate
possession
,
with
Leicester
having
to
dig
in
deep
at
the
back
.
Chelsea
were
soon
presented
with
another
opening
as
N'Golo
Kante
picked
out
the
run
of
Hazard
,
but
he
was
unable
to
connect
properly
in
his
attempt
to
chip
the
outcoming
Schmeichel
.
The
hosts
were
inches
away
from
their
doubling
their
lead
shortly
after
as
David
Luiz
stepped
up
to
take
a
free
kick
on
the
edge
of
the
box
,
with
his
effort
flying
towards
goal
only
to
cannon
back
off
the
post
.
Chelsea
did
make
it
two
in
the
33rd
minute
,
with
Hazard
taking
advantage
of
some
sloppy
Leicester
defending
before
rounding
Schmeichel
and
slotting
into
an
empty
net
.
Leicester
did
manage
to
create
a
half-chance
shortly
before
the
break
as
Jamie
Vardy
just
failed
to
connect
with
Luis
Hernandez
's
delivery
,
while
Luiz
went
close
from
a
free
kick
again
down
the
other
end
,
this
time
forcing
Schmeichel
to
palm
his
effort
away
.
The
Blues
were
the
first
to
threaten
in
the
second
half
as
they
nearly
made
it
three
,
with
Moses
latching
onto
the
end
of
Kante
's
ball
but
then
failing
to
slot
past
Schmeichel
.
Leicester
could
have
pulled
one
back
thanks
to
Luiz
,
but
luckily
for
the
Brazilian
,
the
ball
came
back
off
the
post
after
he
tried
to
cut
out
Vardy
's
delivery
.
Chelsea
were
still
on
the
hunt
for
a
third
as
the
second
half
wore
on
but
Kante
saw
his
effort
blocked
on
the
line
after
Schmeichel
had
parried
a
ball
into
the
middle
from
Costa
.
But
the
Blues
finally
found
a
third
in
the
80th
minute
as
Moses
was
fed
in
by
a
brilliant
Nathaniel
Chalobah
pass
before
he
fired
past
Schmeichel
and
into
the
back
of
the
net
.
