Chelsea
VS
Middlesbrough
May
9
,
2017
Chelsea
three
points
of
title
after
defeat
of
Middlesbrough
Chelsea
moved
within
three
points
of
the
Premier
League
title
and
consigned
Middlesbrough
to
relegation
with
a
dominant
3-0
victory
at
Stamford
Bridge
.
Goals
from
Diego
Costa
,
Marcos
Alonso
and
Nemanja
Matic
saw
Chelsea
re-establish
a
seven-point
lead
over
Tottenham
.
And
Antonio
Conte
's
men
can
win
the
title
before
Spurs
next
play
with
victory
at
West
Brom
on
Friday
night
.
Costa
scored
his
20th
league
goal
of
the
season
,
converting
a
pass
from
the
excellent
Cesc
Fabregas
,
and
Alonso
netted
from
a
similar
position
before
half-time
.
And
Matic
struck
in
a
second-half
which
began
with
Pedro
hitting
the
bar
as
Brad
Guzan
conceded
through
his
legs
for
a
third
time
.
It
could
have
been
many
more
for
the
champions-elect
in
a
one-sided
contest
.
Boro
,
now
with
one
win
in
19
league
games
,
will
be
playing
in
the
Championship
next
season
after
a
record-equalling
fourth
demotion
from
the
Premier
League
.
The
visitors
'
night
began
with
a
bump
.
A
minor
nudge
in
rush
hour
traffic
contributed
to
the
delayed
arrival
of
the
Boro
bus
.
History
was
also
against
Boro
,
who
were
without
a
league
win
and
had
not
scored
in
seven
games
at
Stamford
Bridge
since
2001
.
Chelsea
's
in-house
TV
channel
showed
the
1997
FA
Cup
final
between
the
teams
prior
to
the
match
,
when
Roberto
di
Matteo
scored
after
42
seconds
.
Chelsea
play
Arsenal
in
the
FA
Cup
final
on
May
27
hoping
to
complete
the
season
with
the
double
.
Di
Matteo
and
his
predecessor
as
Chelsea
boss
Andre
Villas
Boas
lost
their
jobs
after
defeats
at
The
Hawthorns
.
Conte
goes
there
on
Friday
seeking
the
title
in
his
first
season
as
head
coach
.
Bayern
Munich
boss
Carlo
Ancelotti
,
Conte
's
former
boss
at
Juventus
and
a
double
winner
with
Chelsea
in
2009-10
,
was
in
attendance
.
So
were
Chelsea
owner
Roman
Abramovich
and
former
strikers
Andriy
Schevchenko
and
Jimmy
Floyd
Hasselbaink
,
who
also
played
for
Boro
.
Baggies
boss
Tony
Pulis
was
also
present
,
but
if
his
side
avoid
defeat
on
Friday
it
will
only
delay
the
inevitable
as
Chelsea
next
play
mid-table
Watford
and
relegated
Sunderland
at
home
.
There
was
an
expectant
atmosphere
after
Spurs
'
loss
at
West
Ham
on
Friday
night
eased
any
title
anxiety
.
N'Golo
Kante
was
not
risked
due
to
a
minor
thigh
injury
and
Fabregas
,
his
replacement
,
found
his
passing
range
from
the
start
.
The
Spain
playmaker
lofted
the
ball
to
Alonso
,
whose
volley
was
turned
on
to
the
bar
by
Brad
Guzan
in
the
second
minute
.
Boro
did
not
learn
as
Chelsea
repeated
the
trick
time
and
again
.
Home
supporters
sang
``
we
're
going
to
win
the
league
''
as
Chelsea
played
through
,
over
and
around
Boro
almost
at
will
.
Visiting
fans
responded
``
we
're
going
down
.
''
Eden
Hazard
picked
out
Fabregas
in
the
box
,
but
the
midfielder
's
shot
drifted
wide
.
Hazard
again
tried
to
lay
on
a
goal
with
a
cross
which
nutmegged
Fabio
,
but
Costa
was
beaten
to
the
ball
by
George
Friend
.
Chelsea
and
Costa
breached
the
defence
moments
later
.
And
it
was
a
familiar
combination
.
Fabregas
'
lofted
ball
found
Costa
unmarked
six
yards
out
.
He
controlled
the
ball
and
passed
through
the
legs
of
Guzan
,
who
conceded
eight
here
as
Aston
Villa
goalkeeper
in
December
2012
.
Conte
had
told
Costa
and
Fabregas
to
concentrate
on
the
here
and
now
amid
speculation
over
their
futures
and
both
showed
their
value
to
potential
suitors
--
and
to
Chelsea
.
Cesar
Azpilicueta
next
stepped
up
to
mimic
Fabregas
,
clipping
a
pass
over
for
Alonso
to
slide
in
,
shoot
and
score
between
Guzan
's
legs
.
Fabio
was
conspicuous
by
his
absence
,
again
.
Guzan
saved
from
Moses
before
the
interval
and
Pedro
hit
the
bar
within
seconds
of
the
restart
.
Alonso
next
fired
wide
--
and
just
out
of
reach
of
Costa
--
Gary
Cahill
stung
the
hands
of
Guzan
and
a
deflected
Fabregas
effort
went
wide
.
A
third
goal
came
when
Fabregas
found
Matic
,
who
controlled
the
ball
on
his
chest
and
swept
the
ball
in
--
the
third
goal
scored
through
Guzan
's
legs
.
Thibaut
Courtois
was
finally
called
into
action
to
make
a
regulation
save
from
Grant
Leadbitter
as
Chelsea
continued
to
pour
forwards
,
with
Pedro
firing
over
and
Guzan
denying
Moses
.
There
was
time
for
sentiment
from
Conte
as
John
Terry
came
on
for
his
715th
Chelsea
appearance
.
Another
four
are
possible
as
he
seeks
to
take
his
tally
of
14
major
trophies
to
16
before
leaving
this
summer
.
The
Premier
League
appears
certain
to
be
number
15
.
