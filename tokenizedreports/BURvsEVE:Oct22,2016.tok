Burnley
VS
Everton
Oct
22
,
2016
Scott
Arfield
strikes
late
as
Burnley
upset
Everton
Scott
Arfield
's
90th-minute
winner
gave
Burnley
more
home
comforts
as
they
defeated
Everton
2-1
at
Turf
Moor
.
The
midfielder
,
only
restored
to
the
starting
line-up
because
of
an
injury
to
Steven
Defour
,
rifled
in
after
Johann
Berg
Gudmundsson
had
struck
the
crossbar
to
move
the
Clarets
to
10
points
,
all
of
which
have
been
achieved
in
east
Lancashire
.
Sam
Vokes
had
earlier
punished
a
Maarten
Stekelenburg
error
-
a
week
after
his
two
penalty
saves
against
Manchester
City
-
to
give
Burnley
a
first-half
lead
before
Yannick
Bolasie
equalised
with
his
first
Everton
goal
.
Visiting
boss
Ronald
Koeman
had
recalled
Ross
Barkley
after
dropping
him
against
City
last
weekend
and
,
in
front
of
watching
England
assistant
Sammy
Lee
,
his
first
pass
was
misplaced
.
He
was
not
alone
in
wasting
possession
and
after
Dean
Marney
had
given
the
ball
away
,
a
mix-up
between
Ben
Mee
and
Michael
Keane
was
almost
capitalised
on
when
Kevin
Mirallas
drilled
at
Tom
Heaton
.
The
Clarets
'
stopper
came
into
this
game
having
made
a
league-high
39
saves
and
he
added
another
three
inside
16
minutes
by
denying
Romelu
Lukaku
and
Barkley
.
This
was
otherwise
a
scrappy
contest
disrupted
all
too
often
by
the
whistle
of
referee
Mike
Jones
,
who
had
little
choice
but
to
book
Arfield
for
his
cynical
foul
on
Seamus
Coleman
.
Another
challenge
from
Arfield
drew
a
final
warning
from
Jones
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
by
playing
a
key
role
in
the
39th-minute
opener
.
The
Canada
international
latched
on
to
Gudmundsson
's
flick
and
went
beyond
Ashley
Williams
and
,
though
the
Welshman
recovered
to
take
the
sting
out
of
Arfield
's
shot
,
Stekelenburg
misjudged
the
effort
and
could
only
weakly
palm
the
ball
into
Vokes
'
path
.
With
the
visitors
having
dominated
possession
,
this
had
a
somewhat
similar
feel
to
Burnley
's
2-0
win
over
Liverpool
here
in
August
,
though
the
other
top-flight
club
in
Merseyside
would
eventually
make
a
breakthrough
.
Barkley
was
denied
a
penalty
claim
and
Lukaku
nearly
reached
Mirallas
'
cross
before
Bolasie
smashed
in
a
58th-minute
leveller
.
Burnley
's
attack
broke
down
at
Vokes
'
feet
and
when
Mee
was
caught
out
trying
to
reach
Lukaku
,
Everton
had
two
men
haring
down
the
right
.
Bolasie
took
the
onus
upon
himself
to
carry
the
ball
forward
and
he
rifled
a
right-footed
finish
low
into
the
far
corner
.
The
visitors
were
buoyed
by
that
and
Lukaku
would
have
been
presented
with
a
tap-in
had
Keane
not
nudged
Seamus
Coleman
's
centre
away
from
him
.
Another
delivery
,
this
time
from
Bolasie
on
the
left
,
was
heading
for
the
Belgian
too
but
Heaton
was
able
to
claw
the
ball
out
before
it
reached
him
.
Bolasie
was
the
best
player
on
the
pitch
and
an
audacious
attempt
from
30
yards
out
needed
Heaton
's
intervention
to
help
it
over
the
top
.
It
seemed
as
if
Sean
Dyche
's
side
were
happy
to
hang
on
for
a
point
at
that
stage
but
,
at
the
death
,
Arfield
claimed
a
winner
.
Heaton
's
long
free-kick
eventually
found
its
way
to
Gudmundsson
and
though
he
struck
the
crossbar
,
Arfield
converted
the
rebound
by
drilling
home
first
time
into
the
far
corner
from
around
12
yards
out
.
