net
first
win
under
Allardyce
over
Bournemouth
Crystal
Palace
secured
their
first
Premier
League
win
under
Sam
Allardyce
with
a
2-0
victory
over
Bournemouth
on
Tuesday
night
.
Both
sides
struggled
in
the
first
half
as
the
rain
came
down
at
the
Vitality
Stadium
but
the
visitors
needed
less
than
a
minute
after
half-time
to
take
the
lead
through
Scott
Dann
.
Bournemouth
had
the
majority
of
the
possession
in
the
second
half
but
Palace
doubled
their
lead
in
injury
time
through
Christian
Benteke
.
The
result
means
Bournemouth
have
failed
to
win
a
game
in
January
and
Eddie
Howe
made
three
changes
from
the
side
which
drew
2-2
with
Watford
on
January
21
.
Simon
Francis
,
back
from
suspension
,
Brad
Smith
and
Benik
Afobe
replaced
Tyrone
Mings
,
Charlie
Daniels
and
Callum
Wilson
while
for
Palace
,
Patrick
van
Aanholt
was
handed
his
debut
after
joining
from
Sunderland
on
Monday
.
Eagles
winger
Wilfried
Zaha
was
back
in
the
starting
line-up
for
the
first
time
since
he
returned
from
the
African
Nations
Cup
and
came
close
to
putting
the
visitors
in
the
lead
early
on
in
foggy
conditions
.
Some
impressive
footwork
saw
the
Ivory
Coast
international
lose
Bournemouth
's
defence
before
his
low
shot
hit
the
post
.
Bournemouth
struggled
to
get
into
the
game
in
the
opening
15
minutes
,
with
Palace
's
defence
looking
strong
,
but
a
moment
of
nervousness
between
the
back
four
left
Josh
King
with
the
chance
to
pick
their
pocket
.
The
forward
was
given
space
and
time
but
his
curling
shot
was
wide
of
the
mark
.
Speaking
before
the
game
at
the
Vitality
Stadium
,
Palace
manager
Sam
Allardyce
said
that
playing
games
on
transfer
deadline
day
was
unsettling
for
the
players
and
despite
a
couple
of
decent
chances
for
both
sides
,
neither
could
break
through
to
open
the
scoring
in
the
first
half
.
Bournemouth
had
to
wait
for
Palace
to
come
out
for
the
second
half
but
Allaradyce
's
team
talk
seemed
to
work
as
just
55
seconds
after
the
restart
,
Palace
took
the
lead
.
Yohan
Cabaye
's
initial
corner
was
punched
away
by
Artur
Boruc
but
the
ball
fell
to
Van
Aanholt
,
whose
quick
pass
gave
Jason
Puncheon
time
to
curl
the
ball
back
into
the
box
.
Damien
Delaney
's
flick
fell
to
Dann
,
who
slotted
it
home
to
score
his
first
goal
since
September
and
put
Palace
on
course
for
their
first
victory
under
the
former
England
manager
.
Bournemouth
piled
on
the
pressure
after
the
goal
but
despite
a
number
of
chances
,
they
conceded
a
second
in
stoppage
time
.
Andros
Townsend
,
who
has
been
heavily
linked
with
a
move
back
to
Newcastle
,
crossed
and
an
unmarked
Benteke
had
an
easy
task
to
head
into
the
back
of
the
net
.
Bournemouth
have
conceded
at
least
two
goals
in
six
of
their
last
seven
home
league
fixtures
as
they
slip
to
14th
in
the
table
while
Palace
remain
two
points
behind
17th-placed
Swansea
,
who
beat
Southampton
.
