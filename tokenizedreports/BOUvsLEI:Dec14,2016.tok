AFC
Bournemouth
VS
Leicester
City
Dec
14
,
2016
Bournemouth
beat
Leicester
City
with
Marc
Pugh
winner
Marc
Pugh
capped
his
first
start
of
the
season
with
a
smart
strike
as
Bournemouth
outclassed
Leicester
1-0
on
the
south
coast
.
The
Cherries
moved
up
to
eighth
in
the
Premier
League
after
inflicting
Leicester
's
eighth
defeat
in
16
matches
of
their
title
defence
.
Eddie
Howe
's
men
repeatedly
carved
a
chasm
between
Riyad
Mahrez
and
Christian
Fuchs
on
Leicester
's
left
,
and
that
proved
sufficient
for
victory
.
The
Bournemouth
boss
grabbed
full
dividend
from
the
calculated
gamble
to
deploy
full-back
Adam
Smith
in
midfield
,
Nathan
Ake
at
centre
back
and
Jack
Wilshere
in
a
deeper
role
.
Captain
Simon
Francis
'
link
play
with
Smith
regularly
bisected
Leicester
's
slow-reacting
defence
,
culminating
in
Pugh
volleying
home
the
stylish
winner
.
Leicester
were
left
to
rue
another
miserable
performance
,
and
a
chance
to
build
momentum
well
and
truly
wasted
.
Saturday
's
4-2
win
over
Pep
Guardiola
's
Manchester
City
was
meant
to
light
up
Leicester
's
season
,
but
has
instead
proved
merely
another
false
start
.
Howe
's
tactical
acumen
compromised
Leicester
's
defensive
stability
for
Pugh
's
finely-worked
winning
goal
.
The
hosts
spent
every
waking
first-half
moment
exploiting
a
perceived
weakness
in
Leicester
's
inside-right
channel
.
Claudio
Ranieri
's
men
flatly
ignored
several
warnings
,
before
the
Cherries
'
analysis-room
ploy
bore
fruit
.
Francis
sent
Adam
Smith
into
that
exposed
right
channel
,
and
the
newly-minted
midfield
man
delivered
an
expert
cross
.
Benik
Afobe
met
Smith
's
cutback
on
the
run
,
drawing
a
smart
save
from
Ron-Robert
Zieler
at
the
near
post
.
The
Leicester
keeper
could
only
parry
however
,
teeing
up
a
tough
chance
for
Pugh
.
The
grafting
midfielder
produced
a
fine
technical
finish
however
,
holding
his
shape
well
in
staying
over
the
top
of
the
ball
when
volleying
home
.
Bournemouth
fully
merited
their
1-0
half-time
lead
,
their
goal
capping
clear
dominance
.
Just
when
the
home
faithful
feared
the
Cherries
would
turn
around
empty-handed
,
Pugh
struck
.
Harry
Arter
's
fury
at
receiving
no
free
kick
when
running
40
yards
with
Robert
Huth
climbing
all
over
his
back
fired
up
Bournemouth
as
much
as
the
crowd
.
Leicester
had
no
answers
to
Howe
's
men
before
the
break
,
with
Vardy
shut
down
by
Steve
Cook
when
fighting
to
round
Artur
Boruc
.
Islam
Slimani
swung
his
left
boot
at
fresh
air
from
Marc
Albrighton
's
teasing
cross
,
but
Leicester
could
point
to
little
else
of
note
in
the
first
half
.
Smith
fired
over
from
a
promising
station
in
that
well-worn
right
channel
after
the
interval
.
Bournemouth
impressed
in
the
early
stages
,
but
ran
out
of
steam
on
the
hour
.
A
clutch
of
miscued
passes
,
including
two
from
goalkeeper
Boruc
,
handed
Leicester
a
territorial
foothold
.
Callum
Wilson
replaced
Afobe
in
a
bid
to
add
impetus
to
the
hosts
,
but
Leicester
still
pressed
their
claims
.
Huth
headed
wide
from
a
corner
when
unmarked
at
the
far
post
,
then
Shinji
Okazaki
proved
equally
wayward
with
a
20-yard
dip
.
Ranieri
pitched
Leonardo
Ulloa
into
a
three-man
attack
at
the
expense
of
withdrawing
defender
Huth
in
the
closing
stages
,
so
desperate
was
the
Italian
to
snatch
any
kind
of
result
.
Cook
blocked
first
from
Mahrez
then
too
from
Okazaki
,
the
second
intervention
proving
crucial
with
the
Leicester
striker
through
on
goal
.
Bournemouth
's
defending
became
ever
more
frantic
as
the
match
inched
to
a
close
,
with
Boruc
saving
from
Ulloa
at
close
range
.
Both
teams
reaped
their
just
rewards
however
,
with
Howe
's
Bournemouth
again
proving
their
Premier
League
mettle
.
