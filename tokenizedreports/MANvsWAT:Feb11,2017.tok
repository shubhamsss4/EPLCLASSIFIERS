Anthony
Martial
scores
as
Manchester
United
beat
Watford
Anthony
Martial
impressed
on
his
return
to
the
Manchester
United
starting
lineup
,
scoring
one
and
providing
the
other
as
Jose
Mourinho
's
men
comfortably
overcame
Watford
.
The
player
started
brightly
when
he
arrived
from
Monaco
but
has
struggled
to
recapture
that
form
this
term
,
with
his
lack
of
game
time
leading
to
questions
over
his
happiness
and
Old
Trafford
future
.
Martial
this
week
took
to
social
media
to
dismiss
the
rumours
and
let
his
feet
do
the
talking
upon
with
a
starting
role
against
Watford
,
setting
up
Juan
Mata
's
opener
and
scoring
a
smart
second
to
secure
a
2-0
win
on
Saturday
.
It
was
an
important
victory
as
the
race
for
the
top
four
heats
up
and
extended
United
's
unbeaten
Premier
League
run
to
a
16th
match
--
their
longest
run
since
Sir
Alex
Ferguson
retired
.
Walter
Mazzarri
's
Watford
had
started
encouragingly
enough
at
Old
Trafford
but
there
was
to
be
no
repeat
of
September
's
memorable
win
as
the
home
side
upped
the
ante
,
with
Mata
turning
home
at
the
end
of
an
impressive
team
move
.
Martial
provided
the
cross
and
then
United
's
second
in
the
60th
minute
,
showing
impressive
belief
and
coolness
to
turn
home
at
the
near
post
having
been
reduced
to
a
watching
brief
for
the
last
two
matches
.
The
21-year-old
was
one
of
two
changes
for
the
first
United
match
since
the
59th
anniversary
of
the
Munich
air
disaster
,
with
players
wearing
black
armbands
in
memory
of
those
that
died
.
The
late
Graham
Taylor
was
also
remembered
by
Sir
Alex
Ferguson
in
the
programme
for
a
game
that
Watford
began
adventurously
.
Troy
Deeney
was
flanked
by
exciting
January
signings
M'Baye
Niang
and
Mauro
Zarate
,
with
the
latter
frustrated
by
the
former
trying
his
luck
from
the
edge
of
the
box
rather
than
playing
him
through
.
Jose
Holebas
flashed
a
left-footed
strike
just
across
the
face
of
goal
and
Zarate
saw
an
overhead
kick
saved
in
an
open
start
to
proceedings
,
but
it
was
far
from
one-way
traffic
.
Henrikh
Mkhitaryan
and
Zlatan
Ibrahimovic
failed
either
side
of
Martial
's
blocked
effort
,
with
Heurelho
Gomes
producing
an
acrobatic
stop
to
claw
away
a
30-yard
attempt
by
Paul
Pogba
.
A
close-range
tap-in
was
chalked
off
by
referee
Robert
Madley
as
United
kept
the
pressure
on
,
with
Ibrahimovic
firing
over
following
a
super
pass
from
Pogba
,
who
was
then
denied
by
the
in-form
Gomes
.
The
Brazilian
superbly
thwarted
Ibrahimovic
after
Ander
Herrera
and
Mkhitaryan
missed
the
target
,
but
there
was
little
the
Hornets
goalkeeper
could
do
to
prevent
United
's
classy
31st-minute
opener
.
Having
sent
a
neat
flick
into
the
path
of
Mkhitaryan
,
Mata
darted
into
the
box
and
turned
home
Daley
Blind
's
low
cross
on
the
edge
of
the
six-yard
box
.
Etienne
Capoue
saw
penalty
claims
waved
away
in
a
brief
break
from
United
's
dominance
,
which
continued
towards
half-time
as
Mkhitaryan
and
Martial
were
frustrated
.
The
latter
was
impressing
on
his
return
to
the
starting
line-up
and
had
Watford
worried
within
two
minutes
into
the
restart
,
flying
down
the
left
and
firing
across
the
face
of
goal
.
Martial
was
proving
a
handful
and
,
after
David
De
Gea
produced
a
fine
save
to
stop
Zarate
's
25-yard
free
kick
,
increased
United
's
advantage
in
the
60th
minute
.
The
21-year-old
burst
into
the
box
with
pace
and
intelligence
,
cutting
back
and
tucking
a
shot
into
the
near
post
to
the
delight
of
the
Stretford
End
.
It
was
just
reward
for
United
's
attacking
intent
but
Watford
were
threatening
at
the
other
end
,
with
the
stumbling
Deeney
hitting
wide
and
forcing
De
Gea
into
action
either
side
of
a
threatening
Niang
cross
.
Ibrahimovic
and
Mkhitaryan
had
shots
saved
at
the
other
end
,
as
did
Marcus
Rashford
after
replacing
Martial
with
10
minutes
remaining
.
United
top
scorer
Ibrahimovic
failed
to
add
a
third
,
turning
an
unorthodox
strike
wide
,
on
an
afternoon
that
saw
United
become
the
first
team
to
win
2,000
points
in
the
Premier
League
.
