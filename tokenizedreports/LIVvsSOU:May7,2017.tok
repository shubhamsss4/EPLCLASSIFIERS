Liverpool
VS
Southampton
May
7
,
2017
James
Milner
denied
as
Liverpool
thwarted
by
stubborn
Southampton
James
Milner
had
a
penalty
saved
as
Liverpool
saw
their
hopes
of
establishing
a
cushion
in
the
chase
for
the
top
four
frustrated
by
a
0-0
home
draw
against
Southampton
.
Liverpool
started
brightly
in
the
sunshine
at
Anfield
and
former
Southampton
player
Nathaniel
Clyne
made
a
foray
down
the
right
,
with
his
cross
towards
Divock
Origi
causing
problems
before
the
visitors
cleared
their
lines
.
And
with
10
minutes
on
the
clock
,
Emre
Can
--
whose
spectacular
bicycle
kick
won
the
game
at
Watford
on
Monday
--
saw
an
overhit
pass
sail
just
over
the
Southampton
bar
from
some
40
yards
out
.
Georgino
Wijnaldum
had
a
looping
header
easily
gathered
by
goalkeeper
Fraser
Forster
before
Liverpool
had
another
chance
on
15
minutes
when
Roberto
Firmino
fired
in
a
shot
that
was
blocked
.
And
although
Liverpool
were
enjoying
the
majority
of
the
possession
they
could
do
little
with
it
as
Southampton
's
defence
stood
firm
.
Philippe
Coutinho
tried
to
change
all
that
,
producing
a
25-yard
strike
but
sending
it
straight
at
Forster
,
and
there
was
audible
frustration
when
Milner
,
in
a
promising
position
,
produced
a
tame
cross
that
was
easily
cleared
.
Firmino
sent
another
effort
straight
at
Forster
before
,
with
just
under
five
minutes
of
an
increasingly
dull
first
half
remaining
,
Can
tried
to
lift
the
mood
but
his
effort
from
the
edge
of
the
area
was
weak
.
Milner
swung
in
a
hopeful
cross
that
was
headed
down
by
Can
towards
Origi
,
but
Southampton
again
cleared
without
any
alarms
as
the
opening
period
limped
to
a
close
.
Clyne
was
trying
to
inject
some
life
into
proceedings
from
Liverpool
,
but
another
run
down
the
right
ended
with
a
cross
straight
into
Forster
's
hands
at
the
near
post
.
Soon
,
Adam
Lallana
was
warming
up
for
Liverpool
as
manager
Jurgen
Klopp
considered
changes
with
his
side
continuing
to
dominate
the
ball
but
failing
to
do
much
with
that
possession
.
But
after
66
minutes
,
the
game
came
to
life
when
a
long
ball
towards
Origi
came
off
the
arm
of
Jack
Stephens
and
referee
Bobby
Madley
pointed
to
the
penalty
spot
.
Milner
stepped
up
in
front
of
the
Kop
--
but
Forster
dived
low
to
his
right
to
make
a
superb
save
.
Klopp
responded
by
readying
both
Lallana
and
Daniel
Sturridge
for
action
but
the
first
change
was
made
by
Southampton
's
Claude
Puel
,
who
took
off
Manolo
Gabbiadini
and
replaced
him
with
Shane
Long
.
Then
Klopp
made
his
moves
,
with
Lucas
off
for
Lallana
and
Sturridge
replacing
Origi
.
Saints
created
a
moment
of
danger
when
Dusan
Tadic
's
whipped
corner
glanced
off
Dejan
Lovren
and
skimmed
just
wide
,
and
the
Kop
voiced
its
frustration
again
when
a
Liverpool
break
moments
later
was
ended
by
a
foul
from
Firmino
.
Nathan
Redmond
lashed
well
over
from
an
angle
for
Southampton
as
the
game
moved
towards
its
final
quarter
of
an
hour
,
before
Coutinho
saw
another
effort
from
the
edge
of
the
box
held
after
Sturridge
had
teed
him
up
.
Sturridge
then
made
room
for
himself
but
prodded
his
finish
at
Forster
,
and
then
Stephens
blocked
well
as
Milner
burst
into
the
area
and
fired
in
a
low
cross
.
Tadic
almost
managed
to
steer
the
ball
into
Long
's
path
inside
the
Liverpool
area
,
only
for
his
pass
to
carry
a
little
too
much
power
,
before
Sturridge
tried
his
luck
again
with
a
snap-shot
that
fizzed
wide
of
the
post
.
Klopp
replaced
Wijnaldum
with
Marko
Grujic
as
time
ticked
away
--
and
his
side
almost
conjured
a
late
breakthrough
when
Coutinho
's
header
from
a
Milner
cross
was
tipped
over
by
Forster
.
