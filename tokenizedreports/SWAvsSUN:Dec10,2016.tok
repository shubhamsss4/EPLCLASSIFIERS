Swansea
City
VS
Sunderland
Dec

,
2016
Bob
Bradley
's
Swansea
seal
vital
win
over
Sunderland
Swansea
relieved
the
pressure
on
under-pressure
manager
Bob
Bradley
with
an
emphatic
3-0
home
victory
over
fellow
strugglers
Sunderland
.
Bradley
had
come
into
the
Premier
League
basement
clash
under
severe
scrutiny
with
only
one
win
in
his
seven
games
in
charge
and
Swansea
at
the
foot
of
the
table
.
But
the
Swans
surged
to
their
biggest
win
of
the
season
with
a
second-half
penalty
from
Gylfi
Sigurdsson
and
,
for
the
second
successive
home
game
,
a
Fernando
Llorente
double
.
The
win
not
only
takes
Swansea
off
the
bottom
,
but
moves
them
up
three
places
outside
the
relegation
zone
.
Sunderland
are
now
bottom
and
the
way
they
folded
after
Sigurdsson
's
opener
will
trouble
boss
David
Moyes
,
particularly
after
they
had
won
three
of
their
previous
four
games
.
After
a
sterile
first
period
,
in
which
the
events
of
Swansea
's
last
home
game
-
the
amazing
5-4
victory
over
Crystal
Palace
-
were
a
distant
memory
,
the
game
turned
on
a
51st-minute
incident
when
Jason
Denayer
handled
Wayne
Routledge
's
cross
.
Referee
Craig
Pawson
adjudged
that
the
Belgium
midfielder
's
arms
were
in
an
unnatural
position
and
Sigurdsson
sent
the
spot-kick
down
the
middle
for
his
sixth
goal
of
the
season
.
Three
minutes
later
the
excellent
Sigurdsson
turned
provider
as
Llorente
,
the
hero
against
Palace
with
an
injury-time
brace
,
struck
again
when
he
swept
home
a
corner
directed
low
into
the
penalty
area
.
Jordan
Pickford
produced
fine
stops
to
prevent
Modou
Barrow
and
Jordi
Amat
extending
Swansea
's
lead
.
But
the
Sunderland
goalkeeper
had
no
answer
when
Llorente
met
Jefferson
Montero
's
cross
10
minutes
from
time
.
Llorente
soon
left
the
field
to
a
hero
's
reception
,
the
Spanish
striker
's
work
for
the
day
done
.
Swansea
enjoyed
some
promising
moments
early
on
,
with
Barrow
surging
past
opponents
and
Llorente
heading
wide
when
under
pressure
at
the
near
post
.
But
Swansea
were
often
betrayed
by
some
woeful
crossing
,
with
Barrow
and
Routledge
the
major
culprits
,
the
pair
making
it
easy
for
the
Blacks
Cats
by
regularly
failing
to
clear
the
first
defender
.
Sunderland
saw
out
the
opening
20
minutes
and
then
threatened
to
seize
control
,
with
Victor
Anichebe
providing
a
focal
point
in
attack
and
Jermain
Defoe
seeking
space
between
defenders
.
The
pair
combined
to
create
Sunderland
's
best
chance
of
a
cagey
first
period
when
Anichebe
collected
Pickford
's
punt
and
sent
Defoe
down
the
left-hand
channel
.
Defoe
beat
Alfie
Mawson
and
broke
into
the
area
,
but
his
angled
shot
just
cleared
the
crossbar
much
to
Swansea
's
relief
.
Sebastian
Larsson
might
have
opened
the
scoring
moments
later
but
for
Defoe
taking
the
ball
off
his
toe
in
front
of
goal
,
while
Swansea
danger
was
restricted
to
Sigurdsson
's
exquisite
set-piece
delivery
.
Mawson
and
Amat
both
headed
over
inviting
Sigurdsson
free-kicks
which
should
have
yielded
more
.
Swansea
nerves
were
stretched
by
Defoe
's
drive
after
the
re-start
,
which
whistled
just
past
a
post
.
But
Denayer
's
error
opened
the
door
for
Swansea
and
there
was
no
way
back
after
Sigurdsson
had
sent
his
spot-kick
straight
down
the
middle
.
