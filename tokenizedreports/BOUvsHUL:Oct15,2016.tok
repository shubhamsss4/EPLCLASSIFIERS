AFC
Bournemouth
VS
Hull
City
Oct
15
,
2016
Bournemouth
put
six
goals
past
Hull
City
in
thrashing
Steve
Cook
atoned
for
a
defensive
howler
by
heading
Bournemouth
's
second
goal
in
an
eventful
200th
club
appearance
as
the
Cherries
hammered
Hull
City
6-1
.
Junior
Stanislas
fired
a
brace
to
add
to
goals
from
Cook
,
Charlie
Daniels
,
Callum
Wilson
and
Dan
Gosling
,
as
Eddie
Howe
's
men
romped
to
their
record
Premier
League
victory
.
Centre-back
Cook
gifted
Hull
possession
then
clumsily
diverted
Ryan
Mason
's
speculative
effort
past
the
wrong-footed
Artur
Boruc
-
before
burying
a
header
at
the
other
end
just
seven
minutes
later
.
Mason
's
fortunate
goal
had
Hull
level
at
1-1
and
Cook
pounding
the
turf
in
disbelief
.
When
the
Cherries
stalwart
nodded
home
Stanislas
'
free-kick
,
he
relished
his
quick-fire
redemption
with
a
conciliatory
wave
to
the
home
support
.
A
dismal
showing
from
Hull
leaves
Mike
Phelan
's
side
without
a
Premier
League
win
in
their
last
six
matches
.
That
this
was
Phelan
's
first
game
as
full-time
manager
after
a
lengthy
caretaker
stint
made
it
all
the
worse
.
Bournemouth
fired
six
Premier
League
goals
for
the
first
time
amid
another
assured
showing
dictated
by
midfield
marshal
Harry
Arter
.
The
26-year-old
picked
the
right
day
to
conduct
the
tempo
,
with
Ireland
boss
Martin
O'Neill
no
doubt
an
impressed
spectator
.
Cherries
manager
Howe
's
possession-based
blueprint
owes
everything
to
link
men
Arter
and
Andrew
Surman
,
the
two
deep-lying
midfielders
a
constant
outlet
for
their
team-mates
.
Bournemouth
immediately
hit
their
attacking
straps
,
the
relentless
Arter
kick-starting
every
fluid
move
.
Stanislas
curled
a
free-kick
off
a
post
and
Daniels
buried
the
follow-up
to
hand
the
hosts
the
ideal
start
.
Hull
spent
the
next
25
minutes
chasing
shadows
as
Eddie
Howe
's
possession
play
took
hold
,
Jordon
Ibe
growing
in
confidence
if
not
end-product
.
Half-chances
unconverted
could
have
cost
the
Cherries
however
,
with
Wilson
striking
the
bar
after
diverting
Ibe
's
low
cut-back
.
Stanislas
saw
a
low
drive
deflected
wide
and
Ibe
blasted
over
from
25
yards
after
being
left
in
acres
of
space
once
too
often
.
Just
when
Bournemouth
looked
to
grapple
total
control
,
though
,
one
mistake
proved
costly
.
Cook
conceded
possession
far
too
cheaply
with
a
stray
pass
,
and
Hull
pounced
.
Another
Cook
blunder
gifted
the
visitors
the
goal
too
,
the
defender
lazily
redirecting
Mason
's
long-range
shot
past
the
blameless
Boruc
.
The
distraught
Cook
punched
the
turf
then
buried
his
face
in
his
shirt
-
but
somehow
found
a
rapid
redemption
.
Just
seven
minutes
later
the
25-year-old
headed
home
Stanislas
'
whipped
free-kick
,
relishing
the
goal
and
also
raising
both
hands
in
apology
to
the
home
faithful
.
Bournemouth
's
dominance
was
then
fully
realised
when
Robert
Snodgrass
crudely
upended
Callum
Wilson
in
the
Hull
box
.
Stanislas
stalked
the
ball
from
his
team-mates
once
the
cast-iron
penalty
was
awarded
,
and
duly
converted
the
spot-kick
,
firing
straight
down
the
middle
.
After
the
break
Hull
were
perhaps
unfortunate
not
to
win
a
penalty
when
Mason
went
down
under
Surman
's
challenge
.
But
after
that
the
visitors
were
unable
to
generate
any
tangible
threat
.
Stanislas
massaged
the
scoreline
with
his
second
and
Bournemouth
's
fourth
goal
,
tapping
in
at
the
far
post
after
an
accurate
low
cross
from
Adam
Smith
.
Wilson
headed
in
the
fifth
,
before
Gosling
curled
home
the
sixth
,
heaping
the
indignity
on
hapless
Hull
.
