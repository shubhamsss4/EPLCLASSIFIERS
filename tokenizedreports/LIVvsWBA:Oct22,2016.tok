Liverpool
see
off
West
Brom
but
miss
chance
to
go
top
Liverpool
missed
the
chance
to
top
the
Premier
League
after
a
dominant
display
brought
them
a
2-1
win
at
home
to
West
Bromwich
Albion
--
but
not
the
two-goal
margin
they
had
needed
to
reach
the
summit
.
Jurgen
Klopp
's
side
had
too
much
pace
and
movement
for
their
opponents
for
large
chunks
of
the
game
and
wanted
a
penalty
in
the
second
minute
when
Sadio
Mane
went
down
under
Allan
Nyom
's
challenge
but
referee
Neil
Swarbrick
said
no
.
Although
Liverpool
were
monopolising
possession
in
the
early
stages
,
they
were
given
a
scare
when
the
visitors
broke
after
13
minutes
.
Nacer
Chadli
found
Matt
Phillips
in
space
,
but
his
attempted
square
ball
on
to
striker
Salomon
Rondon
was
cut
out
.
But
the
home
side
soon
got
back
onto
the
front
foot
with
James
Milner
getting
forward
to
steer
an
effort
just
over
.
And
they
were
in
front
with
20
minutes
played
thanks
to
a
superbly-crafted
goal
.
A
Philippe
Coutinho
dummy
put
Emre
Can
into
space
,
and
when
he
steered
a
pass
to
Roberto
Firmino
,
his
dinked
cross
evaded
Nyom
and
was
sidefooted
past
Ben
Foster
by
the
unmarked
Mane
.
As
the
home
side
searched
for
a
second
,
Lallana
steered
an
effort
over
the
bar
after
some
neat
footwork
inside
the
West
Brom
area
--
but
they
did
not
have
to
wait
for
long
.
Coutinho
was
found
by
Mane
and
dragged
the
ball
beyond
Craig
Dawson
before
sliding
his
finish
inside
the
far
post
.
West
Brom
manager
Tony
Pulis
brought
off
Claudio
Yacob
for
Chris
Brunt
at
the
break
,
but
there
was
no
change
to
the
pattern
of
the
match
.
Mane
almost
set
up
a
third
when
he
played
in
Coutinho
,
whose
effort
was
blocked
,
before
Nathaniel
Clyne
's
low
cross
was
scraped
away
from
danger
with
attackers
closing
in
.
Another
West
Brom
change
followed
,
with
James
Morrison
on
for
Phillips
,
but
the
visitors
were
soon
grateful
to
keeper
Foster
as
fine
saves
denied
Firmino
and
Dejan
Lovren
.
Nacer
Chadli
briefly
threatened
to
create
some
danger
for
the
visitors
before
being
crowded
out
on
the
edge
of
the
Liverpool
area
but
the
action
again
switched
to
the
other
end
as
only
a
fine
Jonas
Olsson
block
prevented
Can
from
firing
home
a
third
.
Pulis
made
his
final
change
as
Wales
forward
Hal
Robson-Kanu
came
on
for
James
McClean
,
and
the
Baggies
almost
pulled
one
back
when
Chadli
made
himself
some
space
but
fired
over
the
bar
following
a
corner
.
As
the
game
approached
the
final
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
visitors
hunted
for
a
lifeline
,
Morrison
fired
over
the
top
from
20
yards
.
Klopp
made
a
change
,
bringing
on
Georginio
Wijnaldum
in
place
of
Lallana
--
but
within
moments
of
that
substitution
what
had
been
a
thoroughly
comfortable
evening
became
altogether
more
jittery
as
Liverpool
goalkeeper
Loris
Karius
gave
away
a
corner
which
was
thumped
in
by
the
unmarked
Gareth
McAuley
.
Foster
made
good
stops
from
Firmino
and
Coutinho
as
Liverpool
looked
to
regain
their
two-goal
cushion
,
but
with
five
minutes
remaining
Chadli
again
created
a
moment
of
threat
before
blasting
over
from
20
yards
.
Coutinho
fired
straight
at
Foster
in
his
last
action
of
the
game
before
being
replaced
by
Lucas
Leiva
and
Divock
Origi
came
on
for
Mane
as
Klopp
and
Liverpool
saw
the
match
out
.
