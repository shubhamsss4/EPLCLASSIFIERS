Liverpool thrash Watford to go top of the Premier League

Liverpool went top of the Premier League with a convincing 6-1 victory against Watford courtesy of goals from Philippe Coutinho, Emre Can, Roberto Firmino, Georginio Wijnaldum and a brace from Sadio Mane before Daryl Janmaat scored a late consolation for the Hornets.
Thanks to Manchester City and Arsenal both dropping points this weekend, Jurgen Klopp's side knew they could go into the international break as league leaders should they win, and they took the opportunity with both hands.
Liverpool set the tone early on as Lucas forced a save from Heurelho Gomes and Coutinho shot narrowly wide before Mane opened the scoring with a well-directed header from Coutinho's corner in the 27th minute.
Three minutes later Coutinho produced a fine low shot to double Liverpool's lead and put them in a commanding position.
And the afternoon soon got worse for Watford as Gomes limped off to be replaced by Costel Pantilimon.
Liverpool, who looked capable of scoring every time they went forward, added a third through Can as the German headed in unopposed at the back-post from Adam Lallana's cross.
A fourth goal came shortly before the hour mark with Lallana again the provider, cutting back for Firmino to score into an empty net before Mane grabbed his second of the afternoon and Liverpool's fifth, the Senegal international side-footing home after being set up by Firmino.
With 15 minutes remaining Daryl Janmaat scored a consolation with a placed finish after good work by Nordin Amrabat on the right wing.
Substitute Daniel Sturridge forced Pantilimon to turn a spectacular effort onto the crossbar in the closing stages as Liverpool pressed for a sixth.
Then, in added time, Sturridge again drew a save from Pantilimon, who could only parry into the path of substitute Georginio Wijnaldum as Liverpool rounded off the victory with a sixth goal.
